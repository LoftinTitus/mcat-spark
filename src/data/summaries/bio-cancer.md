# Cancer: Cellular and Molecular Basis

## Overview
Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and division. It arises from genetic and epigenetic changes that disrupt normal regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and differentiation. Understanding cancer at the cellular and molecular level is essential for the MCAT.

## 1. Hallmarks of Cancer
- **Uncontrolled proliferation:** Loss of normal cell cycle control
- **Evading apoptosis:** Resistance to programmed cell death
- **Sustained angiogenesis:** Formation of new blood vessels to supply tumor
- **Limitless replicative potential:** Activation of telomerase
- **Tissue invasion & metastasis:** Spread to distant sites
- **Evading immune destruction:** Avoidance of immune surveillance

---

## 2. Cellular Features of Cancer
- **Loss of contact inhibition:** Cells pile up, form disorganized masses
- **Loss of anchorage dependence:** Cells grow without attachment to substrate
- **Abnormal morphology:** Large, irregular nuclei, variable cell size/shape (pleomorphism)
- **Increased mitotic figures:** More cells in mitosis, abnormal spindles
- **Genomic instability:** Chromosomal aberrations, aneuploidy

## 3. Molecular Basis: Gene Regulation in Cancer
- **Oncogenes:** Mutated or overexpressed proto-oncogenes (e.g., Ras, Myc, HER2)
  - Promote cell division, survival, or growth
  - Gain-of-function mutations (dominant)
- **Tumor suppressor genes:** Inhibit cell cycle or promote apoptosis (e.g., p53, Rb, BRCA1/2)
  - Loss-of-function mutations (recessive)
  - "Two-hit hypothesis" (both alleles must be inactivated)
- **DNA repair genes:** Maintain genome integrity (e.g., MSH2, MLH1 in Lynch syndrome)
- **Epigenetic changes:** DNA methylation, histone modification can silence tumor suppressors or activate oncogenes
- **MicroRNAs:** Can regulate oncogene/tumor suppressor expression

---

## 4. Causes & Risk Factors
- **Carcinogens:** Chemicals (tobacco, asbestos), radiation (UV, X-rays), viruses (HPV, EBV, HBV)
- **Inherited mutations:** Familial cancer syndromes (e.g., BRCA1/2, Lynch syndrome)
- **Random mutations:** Errors during DNA replication

---

## 5. Tumor Progression & Metastasis
- **Initiation:** First mutation (often in stem/progenitor cell)
- **Promotion:** Clonal expansion, additional mutations
- **Progression:** Acquisition of malignant traits (invasion, metastasis)
- **Metastasis:** Tumor cells invade basement membrane, enter blood/lymph, colonize distant organs

---

## 6. Clinical & MCAT Relevance
- **Diagnosis:** Biopsy (histology), cytology, molecular markers
- **Treatment:** Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy (e.g., kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies), immunotherapy
- **Drug resistance:** Due to genetic heterogeneity, efflux pumps, DNA repair
- **Prevention:** Screening, lifestyle modification, vaccination (HPV, HBV)

## Quiz

**Q1: Which gene is most commonly mutated in human cancers and acts as a "guardian of the genome"?**
A) Ras
B) p53 *[CORRECT]
C) HER2
D) Myc
**Explanation:** p53 is a tumor suppressor that halts the cell cycle or induces apoptosis in response to DNA damage.

**Q2: What is the main difference between oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes?**
A) Oncogenes inhibit cell division; tumor suppressors promote it
B) Oncogenes are activated by loss-of-function mutations
C) Oncogenes promote cell growth when activated; tumor suppressors prevent growth when inactivated *[CORRECT]
D) Both require two-hit inactivation
**Explanation:** Oncogenes are activated by gain-of-function mutations; tumor suppressors are inactivated by loss-of-function.

**Q3: Which cellular feature is characteristic of cancer cells?**
A) Contact inhibition
B) Anchorage dependence
C) Pleomorphism (variable cell size/shape) *[CORRECT]
D) Stable genome
**Explanation:** Cancer cells often show pleomorphism and loss of normal growth controls.

**Q4: What is the "two-hit hypothesis"?**
A) Both alleles of an oncogene must be activated
B) Both alleles of a tumor suppressor gene must be inactivated *[CORRECT]
C) Two mutations in the same gene are required for cancer
D) Two different carcinogens are needed
**Explanation:** Both copies of a tumor suppressor gene must be lost for cancer to develop.

**Q5: Which process allows cancer cells to spread to distant organs?**
A) Angiogenesis
B) Apoptosis
C) Metastasis *[CORRECT]
D) Differentiation
**Explanation:** Metastasis is the process by which cancer cells invade and colonize distant tissues.
