# Cell Cycle & Mitosis

## Overview
The cell cycle is the series of events that cells go through as they grow and divide. Mitosis is the process of nuclear division that produces two genetically identical daughter cells. Understanding the regulation, checkpoints, and molecular details of the cell cycle and mitosis is essential for the MCAT.

## 1. Phases of the Cell Cycle
- **Interphase:** Period of growth and DNA replication
  - **G1 phase (Gap 1):** Cell grows, synthesizes proteins/organelles; G1 checkpoint (restriction point) checks for DNA damage, cell size, nutrients
  - **S phase (Synthesis):** DNA replication; each chromosome becomes two sister chromatids
  - **G2 phase (Gap 2):** Further growth, preparation for mitosis; G2 checkpoint checks for DNA replication errors, damage
- **M phase (Mitosis + Cytokinesis):** Division of nucleus and cytoplasm
- **G0 phase:** Quiescent state; non-dividing, differentiated cells (e.g., neurons)

## 2. Cell Cycle Regulation
- **Cyclins:** Regulatory proteins whose levels fluctuate during the cycle
- **Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs):** Enzymes activated by cyclins; phosphorylate target proteins to drive cell cycle progression
- **Checkpoints:**
  - **G1/S checkpoint:** DNA damage, cell size, growth factors
  - **G2/M checkpoint:** DNA replication completion, DNA damage
  - **Spindle (M) checkpoint:** Chromosome attachment to spindle before anaphase
- **Tumor suppressors:**
  - **p53:** Halts cycle at G1/S if DNA damaged; induces apoptosis if damage is severe
  - **Rb (retinoblastoma protein):** Inhibits G1/S transition; inactivated by phosphorylation
- **Oncogenes:** Mutated genes that drive uncontrolled division (e.g., cyclin D, CDK4, Myc)

## 3. Mitosis: Steps & Molecular Events
- **Prophase:**
  - Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes (sister chromatids joined at centromere)
  - Mitotic spindle forms (microtubules from centrosomes)
  - Nuclear envelope begins to break down
- **Prometaphase:**
  - Nuclear envelope fragments
  - Spindle microtubules attach to kinetochores (protein complexes at centromeres)
- **Metaphase:**
  - Chromosomes align at metaphase plate (equator)
  - Spindle checkpoint ensures all kinetochores are attached
- **Anaphase:**
  - Sister chromatids separate (cohesin proteins cleaved)
  - Chromatids pulled to opposite poles by shortening microtubules
- **Telophase:**
  - Chromatids arrive at poles, decondense into chromatin
  - Nuclear envelope re-forms around each set
  - Spindle disassembles
- **Cytokinesis:**
  - Division of cytoplasm (animal cells: cleavage furrow via actin/myosin; plant cells: cell plate formation)

## 4. Clinical & MCAT Relevance
- **Cancer:** Uncontrolled cell division due to checkpoint failure, oncogene activation, tumor suppressor loss
- **Chemotherapy:** Many drugs target mitosis (e.g., taxanes, vinca alkaloids disrupt microtubules)
- **Aneuploidy:** Errors in mitosis can cause abnormal chromosome number (rare in mitosis, common in meiosis)
- **Stem cells:** High mitotic activity; G0 exit for tissue repair

## Quiz

**Q1: What is the main function of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in the cell cycle?**
A) Degrade DNA
B) Phosphorylate target proteins to regulate cell cycle progression *[CORRECT]
C) Synthesize ribosomes
D) Form the mitotic spindle
**Explanation:** CDKs, when activated by cyclins, phosphorylate proteins to drive the cell cycle forward.

**Q2: During which phase does DNA replication occur?**
A) G1
B) S phase *[CORRECT]
C) G2
D) M phase
**Explanation:** DNA is replicated during the S (synthesis) phase of interphase.

**Q3: What is the role of the spindle checkpoint during mitosis?**
A) Ensure DNA is replicated
B) Ensure all chromosomes are attached to spindle before anaphase *[CORRECT]
C) Repair DNA damage
D) Initiate cytokinesis
**Explanation:** The spindle checkpoint prevents anaphase until all kinetochores are attached to spindle fibers.

**Q4: Which protein is a key tumor suppressor that halts the cell cycle in response to DNA damage?**
A) Cyclin D
B) p53 *[CORRECT]
C) Myc
D) Tubulin
**Explanation:** p53 can arrest the cell cycle or induce apoptosis if DNA is damaged.

**Q5: What cytoskeletal structure is responsible for chromosome movement during anaphase?**
A) Actin filaments
B) Microtubules *[CORRECT]
C) Intermediate filaments
D) Myosin
**Explanation:** Microtubules of the mitotic spindle pull sister chromatids apart during anaphase.
