# Skeletal Tissue: MCAT Review

Skeletal tissue forms the framework of the body, providing support, protection, movement, and mineral storage. It consists of bone and cartilage, each with distinct structure and function. MCAT questions often focus on bone anatomy, physiology, remodeling, and clinical relevance.

## Bone Tissue
- **Types of Bone:**
  - **Compact (Cortical) Bone:** Dense, strong outer layer; provides structural support.
  - **Spongy (Cancellous) Bone:** Porous, found at ends of long bones and inside flat bones; contains red marrow.
- **Bone Cells:**
  - **Osteoblasts:** Build bone by secreting matrix and promoting mineralization.
  - **Osteocytes:** Mature bone cells, maintain bone tissue.
  - **Osteoclasts:** Break down bone (resorption), important for remodeling and calcium release.
- **Bone Matrix:**
  - **Organic:** Collagen fibers provide flexibility.
  - **Inorganic:** Hydroxyapatite (calcium phosphate) provides strength.
- **Bone Marrow:**
  - **Red Marrow:** Hematopoiesis (blood cell formation).
  - **Yellow Marrow:** Fat storage.

## Cartilage
- **Types:**
  - **Hyaline Cartilage:** Most common; covers articular surfaces, forms fetal skeleton, supports airways.
  - **Elastic Cartilage:** Flexible; found in ear, epiglottis.
  - **Fibrocartilage:** Tough; intervertebral discs, pubic symphysis.
- **Cells:** Chondrocytes (cartilage cells) in lacunae.
- **Functions:** Shock absorption, smooth joint movement, structural support.

## Bone Growth and Remodeling
- **Endochondral Ossification:** Bone develops from cartilage (long bones).
- **Intramembranous Ossification:** Bone develops directly from mesenchyme (flat bones).
- **Remodeling:** Continuous process; osteoblasts build, osteoclasts resorb. Regulated by hormones (PTH, calcitonin, vitamin D).

## Mineral Homeostasis
- **Calcium and Phosphate:** Stored in bone; released as needed for nerve/muscle function.
- **Hormonal Regulation:**
  - **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH):** Increases blood calcium by stimulating osteoclasts.
  - **Calcitonin:** Lowers blood calcium by inhibiting osteoclasts.
  - **Vitamin D:** Increases calcium absorption from gut.

## Clinical Relevance
- **Osteoporosis:** Loss of bone density; increased fracture risk.
- **Rickets/Osteomalacia:** Defective mineralization (vitamin D deficiency).
- **Fractures:** Disruption of bone continuity; healing involves inflammation, repair, remodeling.
- **Arthritis:** Joint inflammation; may involve cartilage degeneration.

## Quiz

**Q1: Which cell type is responsible for bone resorption?**
A) Osteoblast
B) Osteocyte
C) Osteoclast *[CORRECT]
D) Chondrocyte
**Explanation:** Osteoclasts break down bone matrix, releasing calcium and phosphate.

**Q2: What is the main mineral component of bone matrix?**
A) Collagen
B) Hydroxyapatite *[CORRECT]
C) Elastin
D) Keratin
**Explanation:** Hydroxyapatite (calcium phosphate) provides bone strength and rigidity.

**Q3: Which hormone increases blood calcium by stimulating osteoclast activity?**
A) Calcitonin
B) Parathyroid hormone (PTH) *[CORRECT]
C) Insulin
D) Thyroxine
**Explanation:** PTH increases blood calcium by promoting bone resorption.

**Q4: Which type of cartilage is found in intervertebral discs?**
A) Hyaline cartilage
B) Elastic cartilage
C) Fibrocartilage *[CORRECT]
D) Articular cartilage
**Explanation:** Fibrocartilage is tough and found in intervertebral discs and pubic symphysis.

**Q5: What is the process by which long bones develop from cartilage?**
A) Intramembranous ossification
B) Endochondral ossification *[CORRECT]
C) Hematopoiesis
D) Mineralization
**Explanation:** Endochondral ossification is the process of bone formation from cartilage templates.
