# Nephrons: Structure, Function, and MCAT Relevance

The nephron is the fundamental functional unit of the kidney, responsible for filtering blood, maintaining homeostasis, and forming urine. Each human kidney contains about 1 million nephrons, which work in parallel to regulate fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance.

## Nephron Anatomy
- **Renal Corpuscle:** Composed of the glomerulus (a tuft of capillaries) and Bowman's capsule. This is the site of blood filtration.
- **Renal Tubule:** Includes the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), loop of Henle (descending and ascending limbs), distal convoluted tubule (DCT), and collecting duct.

## Filtration
- Occurs at the glomerulus, where hydrostatic pressure forces water and small solutes (glucose, amino acids, ions, urea) into Bowman's capsule.
- Large proteins and blood cells are retained in the bloodstream.
- The filtrate volume is about 180 L/day, but most is reabsorbed.

## Reabsorption
- **Proximal Tubule:** Reabsorbs ~65% of filtered water, sodium, chloride, glucose, amino acids, and bicarbonate. Uses active and passive transport.
- **Loop of Henle:** Descending limb is permeable to water (reabsorbed), ascending limb is impermeable to water but actively transports Na+, K+, and Cl- out, creating a medullary osmotic gradient.
- **Distal Tubule:** Fine-tunes sodium, potassium, and acid-base balance. Aldosterone increases Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion.
- **Collecting Duct:** Regulates final water reabsorption under antidiuretic hormone (ADH) control. ADH increases water permeability, concentrating urine.

## Secretion
- Tubular cells actively secrete substances (H+, K+, NH4+, drugs) into the filtrate for excretion.

## Hormonal Regulation
- **Aldosterone:** Increases Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion in the distal tubule and collecting duct.
- **ADH (vasopressin):** Increases water reabsorption in the collecting duct.
- **Parathyroid hormone (PTH):** Increases Ca2+ reabsorption in the distal tubule.

## Clinical Relevance
- **Renal Failure:** Loss of nephron function leads to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalance, and accumulation of toxins.
- **Diabetes Mellitus:** High glucose damages glomeruli, leading to proteinuria and nephropathy.
- **Hypertension:** Damages renal blood vessels, impairing filtration.
- **Diuretics:** Drugs that act on different nephron segments to increase urine output (e.g., loop diuretics inhibit Na+/K+/2Cl- transporter in the loop of Henle).
