# Social Interaction

## Overview
Social interaction refers to the ways in which people act toward, respond to, and influence one another. It is the foundation of social life and a core concept in sociology and psychology. On the MCAT, understanding social interaction is essential for analyzing group dynamics, communication, and the impact of social context on behavior.

## Elements of Social Interaction
- **Status:** A recognized social position (e.g., student, doctor, parent).
  - **Ascribed status:** Assigned at birth (e.g., race, gender).
  - **Achieved status:** Earned or chosen (e.g., profession).
  - **Master status:** The most important status a person occupies.
- **Role:** Expected behaviors associated with a status.
  - **Role conflict:** Tension between roles of different statuses (e.g., student vs. employee).
  - **Role strain:** Tension within a single status (e.g., student balancing assignments).
  - **Role exit:** Leaving a role central to identity.
- **Groups:** Collections of people who interact and share a sense of identity.
  - **Primary groups:** Close, personal relationships (e.g., family, close friends).
  - **Secondary groups:** Larger, more impersonal (e.g., coworkers).
- **Networks:** Webs of social relationships linking individuals.
- **Organizations:** Large, structured groups with specific goals (e.g., hospitals, schools).

## Forms of Social Interaction
- **Social Exchange:** Interactions based on rewards and costs.
- **Cooperation:** Working together for a common goal.
- **Competition:** Striving against others for resources or recognition.
- **Conflict:** Struggles over power, resources, or values.
- **Conformity:** Adjusting behavior to align with group norms (Asch experiment).
- **Obedience:** Following orders from authority (Milgram experiment).
- **Altruism:** Helping others at a cost to oneself.

## Communication
- **Verbal Communication:** Use of words, spoken or written.
- **Nonverbal Communication:** Body language, facial expressions, gestures, tone.
- **Impression Management:** Strategies to influence how others perceive us (Goffman’s dramaturgical approach).
- **Front stage vs. back stage:** Public vs. private self-presentation.

## MCAT Connections
- **Application:** Social interaction affects health behaviors, patient-provider relationships, and group decision-making.
- **Research:** Key for interpreting classic studies (Asch, Milgram, Zimbardo) and experimental design.
- **Critical Thinking:** Recognize the influence of context, status, and group dynamics on individual behavior.
