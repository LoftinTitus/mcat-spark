# Plasma Membrane

## Overview
The plasma membrane (cell membrane) is a selectively permeable barrier that surrounds all cells, maintaining homeostasis and mediating communication with the environment. Its structure and function are central to many MCAT topics in cell biology and physiology.

## 1. Structure: Fluid Mosaic Model
- **Phospholipid bilayer:** Hydrophilic (polar) heads face outward; hydrophobic (nonpolar) tails face inward
- **Fluidity:** Lipids and proteins move laterally; cholesterol modulates fluidity
- **Proteins:** Integral (transmembrane) and peripheral; serve as channels, receptors, enzymes, anchors
- **Carbohydrates:** Glycoproteins and glycolipids on extracellular surface; cell recognition, signaling
- **Asymmetry:** Inner and outer leaflets have different lipid/protein composition

---

## 2. Functions
- **Barrier:** Separates intracellular and extracellular environments
- **Selective permeability:** Controls entry/exit of substances
- **Transport:**
  - **Passive:** Simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion (channels, carriers), osmosis
  - **Active:** Primary (ATP-driven, e.g., Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase), secondary (uses gradients)
- **Cell signaling:** Receptors for hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors
- **Cell adhesion:** Junctions (tight, gap, desmosomes)
- **Endocytosis/exocytosis:** Bulk transport of large molecules/particles

## 3. Transport Across the Membrane
- **Simple diffusion:** Small, nonpolar molecules (O₂, CO₂, steroids)
- **Facilitated diffusion:** Ions, polar molecules via channels/carriers (e.g., glucose transporter, ion channels)
- **Osmosis:** Water movement via aquaporins
- **Active transport:**
  - **Primary:** Direct ATP use (e.g., Na⁺/K⁺ pump)
  - **Secondary:** Uses electrochemical gradient (e.g., Na⁺/glucose cotransporter)
- **Vesicular transport:**
  - **Endocytosis:** Phagocytosis (solids), pinocytosis (liquids), receptor-mediated
  - **Exocytosis:** Secretion of proteins, neurotransmitters

---

## 4. Membrane Potential & Signaling
- **Resting membrane potential:** Maintained by ion gradients (mainly Na⁺, K⁺)
- **Action potentials:** Rapid changes in membrane potential (neurons, muscle)
- **Receptors:** GPCRs, RTKs, ion channels
- **Signal transduction:** Initiated at membrane, leads to cellular responses

---

## 5. Clinical & MCAT Relevance
- **Cystic fibrosis:** Defective Cl⁻ channel (CFTR)
- **Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase:** Target of cardiac glycosides (digoxin)
- **Cholesterol:** Excess alters fluidity, leads to atherosclerosis
- **Autoimmune diseases:** Target membrane proteins (e.g., myasthenia gravis)
- **Drug delivery:** Lipid-soluble drugs cross easily; large/polar drugs need transporters

A) Simple diffusion
B) Facilitated diffusion
C) Primary active transport *[CORRECT]
D) Secondary active transport
**Explanation:** Primary active transport (e.g., Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase) uses ATP directly.

A) Glucose
B) Na⁺ ions
C) O₂ and CO₂ *[CORRECT]
D) Proteins
**Explanation:** Small, nonpolar molecules like O₂ and CO₂ diffuse freely across the membrane.

**Q4: What is the function of cholesterol in the plasma membrane?**
A) Energy storage
B) Modulates membrane fluidity *[CORRECT]
C) Cell signaling
D) Forms ion channels
**Explanation:** Cholesterol stabilizes membrane fluidity, especially at temperature extremes.

**Q5: Which disease is caused by a defect in a plasma membrane ion channel?**
A) Sickle cell anemia
B) Cystic fibrosis *[CORRECT]
C) Diabetes mellitus
D) Hemophilia
**Explanation:** Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR Cl⁻ channel gene.
