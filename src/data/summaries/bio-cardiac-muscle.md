# Cardiac Muscle: MCAT Review

Cardiac muscle is a specialized, involuntary muscle tissue found only in the heart. It is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body and exhibits unique structural and functional properties. MCAT questions often focus on cardiac muscle anatomy, physiology, electrical conduction, and clinical relevance.

## Structure
- **Cells (Cardiomyocytes):** Short, branched, striated cells with one or two central nuclei.
- **Intercalated Discs:** Specialized junctions containing desmosomes (mechanical strength) and gap junctions (electrical coupling), allowing rapid, coordinated contraction.
- **Sarcomeres:** Contractile units composed of actin and myosin, similar to skeletal muscle.
- **Mitochondria:** Abundant, supporting high aerobic metabolism.

## Function
- **Automaticity:** Some cells (pacemaker cells) can spontaneously generate action potentials (e.g., SA node).
- **Involuntary Control:** Regulated by autonomic nervous system (sympathetic increases rate/force, parasympathetic decreases rate).
- **Excitation-Contraction Coupling:** Calcium-induced calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum triggers contraction.
- **Refractory Period:** Long absolute refractory period prevents tetanus, ensuring rhythmic contractions.

## Electrical Conduction System
- **SA Node:** Primary pacemaker; initiates heartbeat.
- **AV Node:** Delays impulse, allowing ventricular filling.
- **Bundle of His, Bundle Branches, Purkinje Fibers:** Rapidly conduct impulses to ventricles for coordinated contraction.

## Clinical Relevance
- **Arrhythmias:** Abnormal electrical activity; can affect rate, rhythm, and efficiency of pumping.
- **Heart Failure:** Impaired contractility or relaxation; reduced cardiac output.
- **Myocardial Infarction:** Death of cardiac muscle due to ischemia (blocked blood flow).
- **Cardiomyopathies:** Diseases affecting muscle structure/function.

## Quiz

**Q1: What structure allows cardiac muscle cells to contract in a coordinated fashion?**
A) Sarcomeres
B) Intercalated discs *[CORRECT]
C) T-tubules
D) Z-lines
**Explanation:** Intercalated discs contain gap junctions for electrical coupling and desmosomes for mechanical strength.

**Q2: Which property prevents tetanus in cardiac muscle?**
A) Short refractory period
B) Long absolute refractory period *[CORRECT]
C) Lack of sarcomeres
D) Voluntary control
**Explanation:** The long refractory period ensures rhythmic contractions and prevents sustained contraction (tetanus).

**Q3: Which node is the primary pacemaker of the heart?**
A) AV node
B) SA node *[CORRECT]
C) Purkinje fibers
D) Bundle of His
**Explanation:** The SA node initiates the heartbeat and sets the pace.

**Q4: What triggers contraction in cardiac muscle cells?**
A) Sodium influx
B) Calcium-induced calcium release *[CORRECT]
C) Potassium efflux
D) ATP hydrolysis
**Explanation:** Calcium entry triggers further calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to contraction.

**Q5: Which condition results from death of cardiac muscle due to blocked blood flow?**
A) Arrhythmia
B) Myocardial infarction *[CORRECT]
C) Heart failure
D) Cardiomyopathy
**Explanation:** Myocardial infarction (heart attack) is caused by ischemia and cell death in cardiac muscle.
