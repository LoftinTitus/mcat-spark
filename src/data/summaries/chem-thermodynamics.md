## Thermodynamics

### First Law
Energy is conserved: ΔU = q + w
- q = heat
- w = work = -PΔV (for expansion)

### Enthalpy (H)
- ΔH < 0: exothermic
- ΔH > 0: endothermic
- ΔH°rxn = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants)

### Entropy (S)
Measure of disorder
- ΔS > 0: more disorder (favorable)
- Increases with: more moles of gas, higher T, phase transitions (s→l→g)

### Gibbs Free Energy
```
ΔG = ΔH - TΔS
```
- ΔG < 0: spontaneous
- ΔG > 0: non-spontaneous
- ΔG = 0: equilibrium

### Relationship to K
```
ΔG° = -RT ln K
```
- K > 1: ΔG° < 0 (products favored)
- K < 1: ΔG° > 0 (reactants favored)
