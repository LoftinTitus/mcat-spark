## Thermodynamics

### First Law of Thermodynamics
- **Energy is conserved:** ΔU = q + w
  - ΔU: change in internal energy
  - q: heat added to the system (q > 0 = endothermic)
  - w: work done on the system (w > 0 = compression)
  - For gases: w = -PΔV (expansion: w < 0, compression: w > 0)
- **MCAT Tip:** Internal energy depends only on state, not path (state function).

### Enthalpy (H)
- **ΔH:** Heat change at constant pressure
  - ΔH < 0: exothermic (releases heat)
  - ΔH > 0: endothermic (absorbs heat)
- **Standard enthalpy of reaction:**
  - ΔH°rxn = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants)
  - ΔH°f: standard enthalpy of formation (element in standard state = 0)
- **MCAT Tip:** Bond breaking is endothermic (+ΔH), bond forming is exothermic (–ΔH).

### Entropy (S)
- **Measure of disorder/randomness**
  - ΔS > 0: more disorder (favorable)
  - ΔS < 0: less disorder (unfavorable)
- **Increases with:**
  - More moles of gas
  - Higher temperature
  - Phase transitions: solid → liquid → gas (ΔS > 0)
- **MCAT Tip:** Dissolving salts usually increases entropy.

### Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG)
```
ΔG = ΔH - TΔS
```
- **ΔG < 0:** spontaneous (favorable)
- **ΔG > 0:** non-spontaneous
- **ΔG = 0:** equilibrium
- **Temperature dependence:**
  - If ΔH < 0 and ΔS > 0: always spontaneous
  - If ΔH > 0 and ΔS < 0: never spontaneous
  - If both ΔH and ΔS are positive or negative: spontaneity depends on T
- **MCAT Tip:** Biological systems often couple unfavorable (+ΔG) reactions to ATP hydrolysis (–ΔG).

### Relationship to Equilibrium (K)
```
ΔG° = -RT ln K
```
- **K > 1:** ΔG° < 0 (products favored at equilibrium)
- **K < 1:** ΔG° > 0 (reactants favored)
- **K = 1:** ΔG° = 0
- **R:** 8.314 J/(mol·K); **T:** temperature in Kelvin

### MCAT High-Yield Points
- Know how to use and interpret ΔG = ΔH – TΔS and ΔG° = –RT ln K
- Recognize when entropy and enthalpy changes drive or oppose spontaneity
- Understand the difference between state functions (ΔU, ΔH, ΔS, ΔG) and path functions (q, w)
- Be able to predict the sign of ΔS and ΔH for phase changes and chemical reactions
- Apply thermodynamics to biological systems (e.g., ATP hydrolysis, protein folding)

## Quiz

**Q1: Which of the following is true for a spontaneous process at constant temperature and pressure?**
A) ΔG > 0
B) ΔG < 0 *[CORRECT]
C) ΔH < 0 always
D) ΔS < 0 always
**Explanation:** A negative ΔG indicates a spontaneous process.

**Q2: What is the sign of ΔS when a solid sublimes to a gas?**
A) Positive *[CORRECT]
B) Negative
C) Zero
D) Cannot be determined
**Explanation:** Entropy increases (ΔS > 0) when a solid becomes a gas due to increased disorder.

**Q3: If ΔH > 0 and ΔS > 0, under what condition will a reaction be spontaneous?**
A) At low temperature
B) At high temperature *[CORRECT]
C) Never
D) Always
**Explanation:** When both ΔH and ΔS are positive, the reaction is spontaneous only at high T (ΔG = ΔH – TΔS).

**Q4: For the reaction N₂(g) + 3 H₂(g) → 2 NH₃(g), what is the sign of ΔS?**
A) Positive
B) Negative *[CORRECT]
C) Zero
D) Cannot be determined
**Explanation:** 4 moles of gas become 2 moles, so entropy decreases (ΔS < 0).

**Q5: If ΔG° = –RT ln K and K = 1, what is the value of ΔG°?**
A) Positive
B) Negative
C) Zero *[CORRECT]
D) Cannot be determined
**Explanation:** If K = 1, ln K = 0, so ΔG° = 0 (system at equilibrium).
