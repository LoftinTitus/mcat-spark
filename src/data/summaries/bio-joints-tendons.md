## Joints and Tendons: Structure and Function

### Joints (Articulations)
Joints are anatomical structures where two or more bones meet, allowing for movement and providing mechanical support. They are classified by structure and function:

- **Structural Classification:**
  - **Fibrous joints:** Bones joined by dense connective tissue; little/no movement (e.g., sutures in skull)
  - **Cartilaginous joints:** Bones joined by cartilage; limited movement (e.g., intervertebral discs)
  - **Synovial joints:** Most common; bones separated by a fluid-filled cavity; freely movable (e.g., knee, shoulder)

- **Functional Classification:**
  - **Synarthroses:** Immovable (e.g., skull sutures)
  - **Amphiarthroses:** Slightly movable (e.g., pubic symphysis)
  - **Diarthroses:** Freely movable (e.g., synovial joints)

#### Synovial Joint Anatomy
- **Articular cartilage:** Hyaline cartilage covering bone ends; reduces friction
- **Joint (synovial) cavity:** Space containing synovial fluid
- **Synovial fluid:** Lubricates, nourishes cartilage
- **Articular capsule:** Fibrous outer layer and inner synovial membrane
- **Ligaments:** Dense connective tissue; stabilize joints
- **Bursae and tendon sheaths:** Fluid-filled sacs reducing friction

#### Types of Synovial Joints
- **Hinge (elbow, knee):** Flexion/extension
- **Ball-and-socket (shoulder, hip):** Multiaxial movement
- **Pivot (atlas/axis):** Rotation
- **Saddle (thumb):** Opposition
- **Plane (intercarpal):** Gliding
- **Condyloid (wrist):** Flexion/extension, abduction/adduction

#### MCAT Clinical Relevance
- **Arthritis:** Inflammation of joints (osteoarthritis: wear-and-tear; rheumatoid: autoimmune)
- **Dislocation:** Bones forced out of alignment
- **Sprain:** Ligament injury
- **Bursitis:** Inflammation of bursae

### Tendons
Tendons are strong, fibrous connective tissues that attach muscle to bone, transmitting force to produce movement.

- **Composition:** Dense regular connective tissue; mainly collagen fibers
- **Structure:** Parallel collagen bundles; fibroblasts maintain matrix
- **Function:** Transmit muscle contraction force to bone; stabilize joints
- **Tendon vs. Ligament:** Tendons connect muscle to bone; ligaments connect bone to bone

#### Tendon Healing and Disorders
- **Tendinitis:** Inflammation due to overuse
- **Tendon rupture:** Complete tear; loss of function
- **Healing:** Slow due to poor blood supply

#### MCAT Clinical Relevance
- **Achilles tendon rupture:** Loss of plantar flexion
- **Rotator cuff injuries:** Shoulder instability
- **Tendinopathy:** Chronic tendon degeneration

## Quiz

**Q1: What type of joint allows the greatest range of motion?**
A) Hinge
B) Ball-and-socket *[CORRECT]
C) Pivot
D) Saddle
**Explanation:** Ball-and-socket joints (shoulder, hip) allow movement in multiple axes and planes.

**Q2: What is the main structural protein in tendons?**
A) Elastin
B) Collagen *[CORRECT]
C) Keratin
D) Actin
**Explanation:** Collagen provides strength and flexibility to tendons.

**Q3: Which structure lubricates and nourishes articular cartilage in synovial joints?**
A) Ligament
B) Synovial fluid *[CORRECT]
C) Periosteum
D) Bursa
**Explanation:** Synovial fluid reduces friction and supplies nutrients to cartilage.

**Q4: What is the difference between a tendon and a ligament?**
A) Tendons connect bone to bone; ligaments connect muscle to bone
B) Tendons connect muscle to bone; ligaments connect bone to bone *[CORRECT]
C) Both connect muscle to bone
D) Both connect bone to bone
**Explanation:** Tendons attach muscle to bone; ligaments attach bone to bone.

**Q5: Which condition is characterized by inflammation of the joint capsule and synovial membrane?**
A) Tendinitis
B) Osteoporosis
C) Arthritis *[CORRECT]
D) Bursitis
**Explanation:** Arthritis involves inflammation of joint structures, including the synovial membrane.
