# Transcription & Translation

## Overview
Transcription and translation are the two main steps of gene expression, converting DNA information into functional proteins. Regulation at these steps is crucial for cell function and adaptation.

## 1. Transcription (DNA → RNA)
- **Location:** Nucleus (eukaryotes), cytoplasm (prokaryotes)
- **Template:** DNA antisense (template) strand
- **Enzyme:** RNA polymerase (RNAP)
  - **Prokaryotes:** Single RNAP; sigma factor for initiation
  - **Eukaryotes:** RNAP II (mRNA), RNAP I (rRNA), RNAP III (tRNA, 5S rRNA)
- **Direction:** Synthesizes RNA 5'→3' (reads DNA 3'→5')
- **Initiation:** Promoter region (TATA box in eukaryotes); transcription factors help RNAP bind
- **Elongation:** RNAP moves along DNA, synthesizing pre-mRNA
- **Termination:** Terminator sequence (hairpin in prokaryotes; polyadenylation signal in eukaryotes)

**Eukaryotic mRNA Processing:**
- **5' cap:** 7-methylguanosine added for stability and ribosome binding
- **3' poly-A tail:** ~200 adenines added for stability, export
- **Splicing:** Removal of introns, joining of exons by spliceosome (snRNPs)
- **Alternative splicing:** Generates multiple proteins from one gene

## 2. Translation (mRNA → Protein)
- **Location:** Cytoplasm (on ribosomes); rough ER for secreted/membrane proteins
- **Template:** Mature mRNA
- **Ribosome:** rRNA + proteins; large and small subunits (80S in eukaryotes, 70S in prokaryotes)
- **tRNA:** Brings amino acids; anticodon pairs with mRNA codon
- **Genetic code:** Triplet codons (64 total, 61 sense, 3 stop); degenerate (redundant), unambiguous

**Steps:**
- **Initiation:** Small subunit binds mRNA at start codon (AUG); initiator tRNA (Met) binds; large subunit joins
- **Elongation:** tRNAs bring amino acids to A site; peptide bond forms (peptidyl transferase); ribosome moves 5'→3'
- **Termination:** Stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) recognized by release factor; polypeptide released

**Post-translational Modifications:**
- **Folding:** Chaperones assist
- **Cleavage:** Removal of signal peptides
- **Covalent modifications:** Phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, ubiquitination

## 3. Regulation & Clinical Relevance
- **Transcriptional regulation:** Promoters, enhancers, silencers, transcription factors, epigenetic marks
- **Translation regulation:** microRNAs, initiation factors, mRNA stability
- **Antibiotics:** Many target prokaryotic transcription/translation (e.g., rifampin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol)
- **Genetic diseases:** Splicing defects (e.g., β-thalassemia), nonsense mutations (premature stop), missense mutations

## Quiz

**Q1: What is the function of the 5' cap on eukaryotic mRNA?**
A) Marks the end of the transcript
B) Facilitates ribosome binding and protects mRNA from degradation *[CORRECT]
C) Signals for splicing
D) Adds amino acids to the protein
**Explanation:** The 5' cap is essential for ribosome recognition and mRNA stability.

**Q2: Which enzyme synthesizes RNA from a DNA template during transcription?**
A) DNA polymerase
B) RNA polymerase *[CORRECT]
C) Ligase
D) Reverse transcriptase
**Explanation:** RNA polymerase synthesizes RNA using DNA as a template.

**Q3: What is the start codon for translation in nearly all organisms?**
A) UAA
B) AUG *[CORRECT]
C) UGA
D) UAG
**Explanation:** AUG codes for methionine and is the universal start codon.

**Q4: Which process removes introns from pre-mRNA?**
A) Polyadenylation
B) Splicing *[CORRECT]
C) Capping
D) Translation
**Explanation:** Splicing removes introns and joins exons to form mature mRNA.

**Q5: Which of the following best describes the genetic code?**
A) Each codon codes for multiple amino acids
B) It is degenerate and unambiguous *[CORRECT]
C) It is not universal
D) It uses doublets
**Explanation:** The genetic code is degenerate (multiple codons per amino acid) and unambiguous (each codon = one amino acid).
