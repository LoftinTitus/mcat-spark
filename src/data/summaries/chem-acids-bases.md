## Acids and Bases 

### Key Definitions
- **Arrhenius:** Acids produce H⁺ in water, bases produce OH⁻
- **Brønsted-Lowry:** Acids are proton donors, bases are proton acceptors
- **Lewis:** Acids are electron pair acceptors, bases are electron pair donors
- **MCAT Tip:** All Arrhenius acids/bases are Brønsted-Lowry, and all Brønsted-Lowry are Lewis, but not vice versa.

### Strong vs. Weak Acids/Bases
**Strong Acids** (completely dissociate):
- HCl, HBr, HI, HNO₃, H₂SO₄, HClO₄

**Strong Bases:**
- Group 1 hydroxides (NaOH, KOH)
- Heavy Group 2 hydroxides (Ca(OH)₂, Ba(OH)₂)

**Weak acids/bases:** Partially dissociate; have Ka or Kb values << 1.

### ARIO: Determining Relative Acidity (MCAT High-Yield)
- **A**tom: More electronegative atoms stabilize negative charge (acidity increases across a period). Larger atoms stabilize charge better (acidity increases down a group).
- **R**esonance: Conjugate base stabilized by resonance → stronger acid.
- **I**nduction: Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize negative charge via induction → stronger acid.
- **O**rbital: Negative charge in an orbital with more s-character (sp > sp² > sp³) is more stable → stronger acid.
- **MCAT Tip:** Use ARIO to compare acidity of similar molecules (e.g., carboxylic acid vs. alcohol, phenol vs. ethanol).

### Important Equations
```
pH = -log[H⁺]
pOH = -log[OH⁻]
pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C)
Ka × Kb = Kw = 10⁻¹⁴
```
- **Ka:** Acid dissociation constant; higher Ka = stronger acid
- **pKa:** = –log(Ka); lower pKa = stronger acid
- **Kw:** Ion product of water = 1 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C

### Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation
```
pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])
```
- Use for buffer calculations. Buffer works best when pH ≈ pKa (±1).
- **MCAT Tip:** Buffers resist pH change; best when [A⁻] ≈ [HA].

### Titration Curves
- **Equivalence point:** moles acid = moles base
- **Half-equivalence point:** pH = pKa (for weak acid)
- **Strong acid + strong base:** pH 7 at equivalence
- **Weak acid + strong base:** pH > 7 at equivalence
- **Weak base + strong acid:** pH < 7 at equivalence
- **Indicators:** Chosen so color change occurs near equivalence point

### MCAT High-Yield Points
- Know how to use ARIO to compare acidity/basicity
- Be able to calculate pH, pOH, pKa, and use Henderson-Hasselbalch
- Recognize strong vs. weak acids/bases and their behavior in solution
- Interpret titration curves and buffer systems

## Quiz

**Q1: Which of the following is a Lewis acid but not a Brønsted-Lowry acid?**
A) HCl
B) NH₄⁺
C) BF₃ *[CORRECT]
D) NaOH
**Explanation:** BF₃ accepts an electron pair but does not donate a proton, so it is a Lewis acid but not a Brønsted-Lowry acid.

**Q2: Which factor is most important in stabilizing the conjugate base of acetic acid compared to ethanol?**
A) Atom size
B) Resonance *[CORRECT]
C) Induction
D) Orbital
**Explanation:** The acetate ion is stabilized by resonance, making acetic acid more acidic than ethanol.

**Q3: What is the pH of a 1 × 10⁻³ M HCl solution?**
A) 1
B) 2
C) 3 *[CORRECT]
D) 4
**Explanation:** HCl is a strong acid and fully dissociates; pH = –log(1 × 10⁻³) = 3.

**Q4: Which of the following will increase the acidity of a molecule according to ARIO?**
A) Replacing a hydrogen with a methyl group
B) Adding an electron-withdrawing group near the acidic proton *[CORRECT]
C) Decreasing s-character of the orbital
D) Removing resonance stabilization
**Explanation:** Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize the conjugate base via induction, increasing acidity.

**Q5: At the half-equivalence point of a weak acid titration, which of the following is true?**
A) [HA] = 0
B) [A⁻] = 0
C) pH = pKa *[CORRECT]
D) pH = 7
**Explanation:** At the half-equivalence point, [HA] = [A⁻], so pH = pKa (Henderson-Hasselbalch equation).
