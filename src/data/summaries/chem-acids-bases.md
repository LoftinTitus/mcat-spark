## Acids and Bases

### Key Definitions
- **Arrhenius**: Acids produce H⁺, bases produce OH⁻
- **Brønsted-Lowry**: Acids are proton donors, bases are proton acceptors
- **Lewis**: Acids are electron pair acceptors, bases are electron pair donors

### Strong vs Weak
**Strong Acids** (completely dissociate):
- HCl, HBr, HI, HNO₃, H₂SO₄, HClO₄

**Strong Bases**:
- Group 1 hydroxides (NaOH, KOH)
- Heavy Group 2 hydroxides (Ca(OH)₂, Ba(OH)₂)

### Important Equations
```
pH = -log[H⁺]
pOH = -log[OH⁻]
pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C)
Ka × Kb = Kw = 10⁻¹⁴
```

### Henderson-Hasselbalch
```
pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])
```
Use for buffer calculations. Buffer works best when pH = pKa ± 1.

### Titration Curves
- **Equivalence point**: moles acid = moles base
- **Half-equivalence point**: pH = pKa (for weak acid)
- Strong acid + strong base → pH 7 at equivalence
- Weak acid + strong base → pH > 7 at equivalence
