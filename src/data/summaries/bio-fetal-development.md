## Fetal Development

### Overview
Fetal development is the process by which a fertilized egg becomes a fully formed baby. It involves cell division, differentiation, organogenesis, and growth, regulated by genetic and environmental factors. Understanding the timeline and physiology is essential for MCAT.

### Stages of Development
- **Fertilization:** Sperm and egg fuse to form a zygote (day 0)
- **Cleavage:** Rapid mitotic divisions; forms morula (solid ball of cells)
- **Blastulation:** Morula becomes blastocyst; inner cell mass (embryo) and trophoblast (placenta)
- **Implantation:** Blastocyst embeds in uterine wall (~day 6-7)
- **Gastrulation:** Formation of three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm)
- **Neurulation:** Neural tube forms from ectoderm; precursor to CNS

### Embryonic Period (Weeks 3-8)
- **Organogenesis:** Major organs and structures form
- **Critical period for teratogens:** Drugs, infections, radiation can cause birth defects

### Fetal Period (Weeks 9-Birth)
- **Growth and maturation:** Organs grow and mature; less susceptible to teratogens
- **Developmental milestones:**
  - **Weeks 9-12:** Sex differentiation, ossification
  - **Weeks 13-16:** Rapid growth, limb movement
  - **Weeks 17-20:** Lanugo (fine hair), vernix caseosa (protective coating)
  - **Weeks 21-25:** Surfactant production in lungs begins
  - **Weeks 26-40:** Fat deposition, organ refinement, CNS maturation

### Placenta and Fetal Circulation
- **Placenta:** Exchange of nutrients, gases, wastes; produces hormones (hCG, progesterone, estrogen)
- **Umbilical cord:** Connects fetus to placenta; two arteries (deoxygenated blood), one vein (oxygenated blood)
- **Fetal circulation:**
  - **Ductus venosus:** Bypasses liver
  - **Foramen ovale:** Bypasses lungs (right atrium to left atrium)
  - **Ductus arteriosus:** Bypasses lungs (pulmonary artery to aorta)

### MCAT Clinical Relevance
- **Teratogens:** Alcohol (fetal alcohol syndrome), thalidomide, rubella
- **Congenital defects:** Neural tube defects (spina bifida), heart defects
- **Prematurity:** Respiratory distress syndrome (lack of surfactant)
- **Placental disorders:** Previa, abruption
- **Rh incompatibility:** Hemolytic disease of the newborn

## Quiz

**Q1: What is the function of the foramen ovale in fetal circulation?**
A) Bypasses the liver
B) Bypasses the lungs *[CORRECT]
C) Delivers oxygenated blood to the fetus
D) Connects the umbilical vein to the heart
**Explanation:** The foramen ovale allows blood to flow from the right to left atrium, bypassing the nonfunctional fetal lungs.

**Q2: During which period are teratogens most likely to cause major birth defects?**
A) Fetal period
B) Embryonic period (weeks 3-8) *[CORRECT]
C) Pre-implantation
D) Postnatal period
**Explanation:** Organogenesis occurs during the embryonic period, making it the most sensitive to teratogens.

**Q3: Which germ layer gives rise to the nervous system?**
A) Endoderm
B) Mesoderm
C) Ectoderm *[CORRECT]
D) Trophoblast
**Explanation:** The ectoderm forms the nervous system and skin.

**Q4: What hormone is produced by the placenta to maintain pregnancy?**
A) FSH
B) hCG *[CORRECT]
C) Prolactin
D) Testosterone
**Explanation:** hCG maintains the corpus luteum and progesterone production in early pregnancy.

**Q5: What is the main cause of respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants?**
A) Heart defect
B) Lack of surfactant *[CORRECT]
C) Rh incompatibility
D) Neural tube defect
**Explanation:** Premature infants may lack surfactant, leading to alveolar collapse and respiratory distress.
