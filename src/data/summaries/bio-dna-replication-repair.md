# DNA Replication & Repair

## Overview
DNA replication ensures faithful transmission of genetic information during cell division. DNA repair mechanisms maintain genome integrity by correcting errors and damage. Mutations can arise from replication errors or environmental insults, with diverse consequences.

## 1. DNA Replication: Key Features
- **Semiconservative:** Each daughter DNA has one parental and one new strand
- **Origin of replication:** Site where replication begins; eukaryotes have many per chromosome, prokaryotes usually one
- **Replication fork:** Y-shaped region where DNA is unwound and synthesized
- **Bidirectional:** Replication proceeds in both directions from each origin
- **Leading strand:** Synthesized continuously 5'→3'
- **Lagging strand:** Synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments (5'→3'), later joined by DNA ligase

## 2. Enzymes & Proteins in Replication
- **Helicase:** Unwinds DNA helix
- **Single-stranded binding proteins (SSB):** Stabilize unwound DNA
- **Primase:** Synthesizes short RNA primers for DNA polymerase
- **DNA polymerase:** Adds nucleotides to 3' end; requires primer; has 3'→5' exonuclease (proofreading) activity
  - **Prokaryotes:** DNA pol III (main synthesis), DNA pol I (removes RNA primers, fills gaps)
  - **Eukaryotes:** DNA pol α (primase activity), δ and ε (elongation)
- **DNA ligase:** Seals nicks between Okazaki fragments
- **Topoisomerase:** Relieves supercoiling ahead of fork
- **Telomerase:** Extends telomeres in germ/stem/cancer cells (reverse transcriptase, uses RNA template)

---

## 3. Fidelity & Proofreading
- **High fidelity:** DNA pol has 3'→5' exonuclease activity (removes mismatched bases)
- **Mismatch repair:** Corrects errors missed by proofreading, recognizes new strand by nicks (eukaryotes) or methylation (prokaryotes)

---

## 4. DNA Damage & Repair Mechanisms
- **Spontaneous damage:** Depurination, deamination, single-strand breaks
- **Induced damage:** UV (thymine dimers), chemicals, radiation

**Repair pathways:**
- **Direct repair:** e.g., photolyase reverses thymine dimers (not in humans)
- **Base excision repair (BER):** Removes damaged base, replaces single nucleotide (e.g., deaminated cytosine)
- **Nucleotide excision repair (NER):** Removes bulky lesions (e.g., thymine dimers); defect causes xeroderma pigmentosum
- **Mismatch repair (MMR):** Fixes replication errors; defect causes Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer)
- **Double-strand break repair:**
  - **Homologous recombination (HR):** Error-free, uses sister chromatid as template
  - **Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ):** Error-prone, directly ligates ends

---

## 5. Types of Mutations
- **Point mutations:** Single base change
  - **Silent:** No amino acid change (redundancy)
  - **Missense:** Changes amino acid (e.g., sickle cell: Glu→Val)
  - **Nonsense:** Creates stop codon (truncated protein)
- **Insertions/deletions (indels):** May cause frameshift if not in multiples of 3
- **Splice site mutations:** Affect mRNA splicing
- **Expansions:** Repeats increase (e.g., Huntington's, Fragile X)
- **Chromosomal mutations:** Deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations

**Consequences:**
- **Loss-of-function:** Reduced or absent protein activity
- **Gain-of-function:** New or increased activity
- **Dominant negative:** Mutant protein interferes with normal

---

## Clinical Relevance
- **Cancer:** Often involves mutations in DNA repair genes (e.g., BRCA1/2, p53)
- **Genetic diseases:** Sickle cell, cystic fibrosis, XP, Lynch syndrome
- **Aging:** Telomere shortening, accumulated DNA damage

## Quiz

**Q1: Which enzyme synthesizes the RNA primer during DNA replication?**
A) DNA polymerase
B) Primase *[CORRECT]
C) Ligase
D) Helicase
**Explanation:** Primase synthesizes short RNA primers needed for DNA polymerase to begin synthesis.

**Q2: What is the main function of DNA polymerase's 3'→5' exonuclease activity?**
A) Synthesizing Okazaki fragments
B) Proofreading and removing mismatched bases *[CORRECT]
C) Sealing nicks in DNA
D) Unwinding the DNA helix
**Explanation:** 3'→5' exonuclease activity allows DNA polymerase to remove incorrectly paired bases.

**Q3: Which DNA repair pathway fixes bulky lesions such as thymine dimers?**
A) Base excision repair
B) Nucleotide excision repair *[CORRECT]
C) Mismatch repair
D) Direct repair
**Explanation:** Nucleotide excision repair removes bulky DNA lesions like thymine dimers.

**Q4: A point mutation that creates a premature stop codon is called:**
A) Silent mutation
B) Missense mutation
C) Nonsense mutation *[CORRECT]
D) Frameshift mutation
**Explanation:** Nonsense mutations introduce a stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein.

**Q5: Which repair mechanism is most likely to introduce errors when fixing double-strand breaks?**
A) Homologous recombination
B) Non-homologous end joining *[CORRECT]
C) Mismatch repair
D) Base excision repair
**Explanation:** NHEJ directly joins broken ends and is error-prone, often causing small insertions/deletions.
