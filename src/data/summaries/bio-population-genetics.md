# Population Genetics & The 5 Fingers of Evolution

## Overview
Population genetics studies the distribution and change of allele frequencies in populations, providing the foundation for understanding evolution. The "5 Fingers of Evolution" is a helpful mnemonic for the five main mechanisms that drive changes in genetic variation within populations—crucial for the MCAT.

## 1. Population Genetics Basics
- **Gene Pool:** All the alleles present in a population
- **Allele Frequency:** Proportion of a specific allele among all alleles for a gene
- **Genotype Frequency:** Proportion of a specific genotype in the population
- **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium:** Describes a non-evolving population (allele and genotype frequencies remain constant)
  - Equation: p² + 2pq + q² = 1 (where p and q are allele frequencies)

## 2. The 5 Fingers of Evolution (Mnemonic)
1. **Small Population (Genetic Drift):**
   - Random changes in allele frequencies are more pronounced in small populations
   - Bottleneck and founder effects are examples
2. **Non-Random Mating:**
   - Mating is not random (e.g., inbreeding, assortative mating)
   - Changes genotype frequencies, not allele frequencies
3. **Mutation:**
   - New alleles arise by random changes in DNA
   - Source of genetic variation
4. **Gene Flow (Migration):**
   - Movement of alleles between populations (immigration/emigration)
   - Increases genetic similarity between populations
5. **Natural Selection:**
   - Differential survival and reproduction of individuals with certain genotypes
   - Only mechanism that consistently leads to adaptation

---

## 3. Hardy-Weinberg Assumptions
- Large population size
- Random mating
- No mutation
- No migration
- No natural selection
- If any assumption is violated, evolution occurs

---

## 4. MCAT Relevance
- Calculate allele/genotype frequencies using Hardy-Weinberg
- Recognize which evolutionary force is at play in a scenario
- Understand how each "finger" disrupts equilibrium

## Quiz

**Q1: Which mechanism of evolution is represented by the "small population" finger?**
A) Gene flow
B) Genetic drift *[CORRECT]
C) Mutation
D) Natural selection
**Explanation:** Genetic drift is more pronounced in small populations and can cause random changes in allele frequencies.

**Q2: What does the Hardy-Weinberg equation predict?**
A) The rate of mutation
B) The frequency of alleles and genotypes in a non-evolving population *[CORRECT]
C) The effect of natural selection
D) The number of chromosomes
**Explanation:** Hardy-Weinberg describes allele and genotype frequencies in a population not experiencing evolution.

**Q3: Which evolutionary force involves movement of alleles between populations?**
A) Mutation
B) Gene flow *[CORRECT]
C) Genetic drift
D) Non-random mating
**Explanation:** Gene flow (migration) introduces or removes alleles from a population.

**Q4: Which of the following is NOT an assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?**
A) Large population
B) No mutation
C) Natural selection is occurring *[CORRECT]
D) Random mating
**Explanation:** Hardy-Weinberg assumes no natural selection; if selection occurs, equilibrium is disrupted.

**Q5: Which mechanism of evolution is the only one that consistently leads to adaptation?**
A) Genetic drift
B) Mutation
C) Natural selection *[CORRECT]
D) Gene flow
**Explanation:** Natural selection increases the frequency of advantageous alleles, leading to adaptation.
