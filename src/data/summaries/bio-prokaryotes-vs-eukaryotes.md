# Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes

## Overview
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes are the two fundamental types of cells. Understanding their similarities and differences is essential for the MCAT, especially for topics in cell biology, genetics, and microbiology.

## 1. Cell Structure
| Feature                | Prokaryotes                        | Eukaryotes                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Nucleus                | No (nucleoid region)               | Yes (membrane-bound)              |
| Membrane-bound organelles | No                              | Yes (mitochondria, ER, etc.)      |
| Size                   | Small (0.1–5 μm)                   | Larger (10–100 μm)                |
| Cell wall              | Yes (peptidoglycan in bacteria)    | Plants/fungi (cellulose/chitin); animals lack cell wall |
| Ribosomes              | 70S (smaller)                      | 80S (larger, cytoplasm/ER); 70S in mitochondria/chloroplasts |
| DNA                    | Circular, no histones (bacteria)   | Linear, with histones             |
| Cell division          | Binary fission                     | Mitosis/meiosis                   |
| Plasmids               | Common                             | Rare                              |
| Cytoskeleton           | Simple or absent                   | Complex (microtubules, actin, etc.) |

## 2. Genetic Organization & Expression
- **Prokaryotes:**
  - Single circular chromosome, often with plasmids
  - Genes organized in operons (polycistronic mRNA)
  - Transcription and translation are coupled (occur simultaneously in cytoplasm)
  - No introns (rare exceptions)
- **Eukaryotes:**
  - Multiple linear chromosomes in nucleus
  - Genes usually monocistronic (one gene per mRNA)
  - Transcription in nucleus, translation in cytoplasm
  - Introns and exons; mRNA splicing

---

## 3. Metabolism & Energy
- **Prokaryotes:**
  - Diverse metabolism: aerobic, anaerobic, fermentation, photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation
  - Some use unique pathways (e.g., methanogenesis)
- **Eukaryotes:**
  - Mostly aerobic respiration (mitochondria)
  - Plants/algae: photosynthesis (chloroplasts)

---

## 4. Reproduction & Genetic Exchange
- **Prokaryotes:**
  - Asexual (binary fission)
  - Genetic exchange: transformation (uptake of DNA), transduction (phage-mediated), conjugation (plasmid transfer via pilus)
- **Eukaryotes:**
  - Asexual (mitosis) and sexual (meiosis, fertilization)
  - Genetic recombination during meiosis

---

## 5. Examples
- **Prokaryotes:** Bacteria (E. coli, Staphylococcus), Archaea (methanogens, halophiles)
- **Eukaryotes:** Animals, plants, fungi, protists

---

## 6. Clinical & MCAT Relevance
- **Antibiotics:** Many target prokaryote-specific features (e.g., cell wall, 70S ribosome)
- **Mitochondria/chloroplasts:** Endosymbiotic origin (prokaryote-like features)
- **Pathogens:** Most bacteria are prokaryotes; many eukaryotic pathogens (fungi, protozoa)
- **Gene expression:** Differences in transcription/translation regulation, splicing, operons
