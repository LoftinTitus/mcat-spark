# Hormones: Types, Mechanisms, and Disorders (MCAT Review)

## Overview
Hormones are chemical messengers secreted by endocrine glands that regulate physiology, growth, metabolism, and behavior. Understanding hormone types, mechanisms of action, and clinical relevance is essential for the MCAT.

## 1. Types of Hormones
- **Peptide/Protein Hormones:**
  - Made of amino acids (e.g., insulin, glucagon, growth hormone)
  - Hydrophilic; cannot cross cell membranes
  - Bind to cell surface receptors; use second messengers (cAMP, IP3/DAG)
- **Steroid Hormones:**
  - Derived from cholesterol (e.g., cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, testosterone)
  - Lipophilic; cross cell membranes
  - Bind to intracellular receptors; act as transcription factors to regulate gene expression
- **Amino Acid Derivatives:**
  - Derived from tyrosine or tryptophan (e.g., thyroid hormones, epinephrine, norepinephrine)
  - Can act like peptide or steroid hormones depending on structure

---

## 2. Mechanisms of Hormone Action
- **Endocrine Signaling:**
  - Hormones travel through bloodstream to distant target cells
- **Receptor Binding:**
  - Peptide hormones: bind to cell surface receptors, activate second messenger cascades
  - Steroid hormones: diffuse into cells, bind cytoplasmic/nuclear receptors, alter gene transcription
  - Amino acid derivatives: may act via surface or intracellular receptors
- **Feedback Regulation:**
  - Negative feedback maintains homeostasis (e.g., insulin/glucagon, thyroid hormone)
  - Positive feedback amplifies response (e.g., oxytocin during childbirth)

## 3. Major Endocrine Glands and Hormones
- **Pituitary Gland:**
  - Anterior: GH, ACTH, TSH, LH, FSH, prolactin
  - Posterior: ADH (vasopressin), oxytocin
- **Thyroid Gland:**
  - Thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), calcitonin
- **Parathyroid Glands:**
  - Parathyroid hormone (PTH)
- **Adrenal Glands:**
  - Cortex: cortisol, aldosterone, androgens
  - Medulla: epinephrine, norepinephrine
- **Pancreas:**
  - Insulin, glucagon, somatostatin
- **Gonads:**
  - Ovaries: estrogen, progesterone
  - Testes: testosterone
- **Pineal Gland:**
  - Melatonin

## 4. Disorders and Clinical Relevance
- **Diabetes Mellitus:**
  - Insulin deficiency/resistance; hyperglycemia
- **Hypo/Hyperthyroidism:**
  - Deficiency/excess of thyroid hormones; affects metabolism, energy, weight
- **Cushing's Syndrome:**
  - Excess cortisol; obesity, hypertension, muscle weakness
- **Addison's Disease:**
  - Cortisol/aldosterone deficiency; fatigue, hypotension
- **Growth Disorders:**
  - GH excess (gigantism/acromegaly) or deficiency (dwarfism)
- **Reproductive Disorders:**
  - Infertility, menstrual irregularities, androgen/estrogen imbalance

---

## 5. MCAT Relevance
- Predict effects of hormone excess/deficiency
- Understand feedback loops and endocrine axes (e.g., HPA, HPT, HPG)
- Recognize symptoms and lab findings of common endocrine disorders

## Quiz

**Q1: Which type of hormone can cross the cell membrane and bind intracellular receptors?**
A) Peptide hormone
B) Steroid hormone *[CORRECT]
C) Amino acid derivative
D) Protein hormone
**Explanation:** Steroid hormones are lipophilic and act via intracellular receptors.

**Q2: What is the main second messenger for many peptide hormones?**
A) cAMP *[CORRECT]
B) DNA
C) Cholesterol
D) Melatonin
**Explanation:** Peptide hormones often use cAMP as a second messenger.

**Q3: Which gland produces cortisol?**
A) Thyroid
B) Adrenal cortex *[CORRECT]
C) Pancreas
D) Parathyroid
**Explanation:** The adrenal cortex secretes cortisol.

**Q4: What is a classic symptom of hypothyroidism?**
A) Weight loss
B) Tachycardia
C) Fatigue and weight gain *[CORRECT]
D) Hypertension
**Explanation:** Hypothyroidism causes fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance.

**Q5: Which hormone is involved in positive feedback during childbirth?**
A) Insulin
B) Oxytocin *[CORRECT]
C) Cortisol
D) Testosterone
**Explanation:** Oxytocin release is amplified by positive feedback during labor.
