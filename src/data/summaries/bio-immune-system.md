# Immune System: Overview, Components, and MCAT Relevance

## Overview
The immune system protects the body from pathogens, cancer, and foreign substances. It consists of innate and adaptive branches, each with specialized cells and mechanisms. Understanding its organization and function is essential for the MCAT.

## 1. Innate (Nonspecific) Immunity
- **First Line of Defense:**
  - Physical barriers: skin, mucous membranes
  - Chemical barriers: stomach acid, lysozyme in tears/saliva
- **Second Line of Defense:**
  - **Phagocytes:** Neutrophils, macrophages ingest and destroy invaders
  - **Natural Killer (NK) Cells:** Destroy virus-infected and cancer cells
  - **Inflammation:** Redness, heat, swelling, pain; recruits immune cells
  - **Complement System:** Proteins that enhance phagocytosis, lyse pathogens
  - **Interferons:** Proteins that inhibit viral replication

## 2. Adaptive (Specific) Immunity
- **Lymphocytes:**
  - **B Cells:**
    - Mature in bone marrow
    - Produce antibodies (humoral immunity)
    - Differentiate into plasma cells (antibody production) and memory B cells
  - **T Cells:**
    - Mature in thymus
    - **Helper T Cells (CD4+):** Activate B cells, cytotoxic T cells, macrophages
    - **Cytotoxic T Cells (CD8+):** Kill infected or cancerous cells
    - **Regulatory T Cells:** Suppress immune response
    - **Memory T Cells:** Provide long-term immunity
- **Antigen Presentation:**
  - Dendritic cells, macrophages present antigens to T cells via MHC molecules
- **Immunological Memory:**
  - Faster, stronger response upon re-exposure to same antigen

## 3. Organs and Tissues of the Immune System
- **Primary Lymphoid Organs:**
  - Bone marrow (B cell maturation)
  - Thymus (T cell maturation)
- **Secondary Lymphoid Organs:**
  - Lymph nodes (filter lymph, activate lymphocytes)
  - Spleen (filters blood, immune responses)
  - MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue: tonsils, Peyer’s patches)

---

## 4. Clinical and MCAT Relevance
- **Autoimmune Diseases:** Immune system attacks self (e.g., lupus, type 1 diabetes)
- **Immunodeficiency:** Weakened response (e.g., HIV/AIDS)
- **Allergies:** Exaggerated response to harmless antigens
- **Vaccination:** Induces immunological memory via exposure to antigens
- **Transplant Rejection:** Immune response against foreign tissue

## Quiz

**Q1: Which cell type produces antibodies?**
A) Helper T cell
B) Plasma cell (B cell) *[CORRECT]
C) Macrophage
D) NK cell
**Explanation:** Plasma cells, derived from B cells, secrete antibodies.

**Q2: What is the main function of cytotoxic T cells?**
A) Activate B cells
B) Kill infected or cancerous cells *[CORRECT]
C) Produce antibodies
D) Suppress immune response
**Explanation:** Cytotoxic T cells destroy cells displaying foreign antigens.

**Q3: Which organ is the site of T cell maturation?**
A) Bone marrow
B) Thymus *[CORRECT]
C) Spleen
D) Lymph node
**Explanation:** T cells mature in the thymus.

**Q4: What is the role of the complement system?**
A) Produce antibodies
B) Enhance phagocytosis and lyse pathogens *[CORRECT]
C) Suppress immune response
D) Present antigens
**Explanation:** Complement proteins help destroy pathogens and promote phagocytosis.

**Q5: What is immunological memory?**
A) Immediate response to any antigen
B) Faster, stronger response upon re-exposure to the same antigen *[CORRECT]
C) Suppression of immune response
D) Production of complement proteins
**Explanation:** Immunological memory allows the adaptive immune system to respond more efficiently to previously encountered antigens.
