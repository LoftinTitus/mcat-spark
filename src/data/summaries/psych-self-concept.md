# Self Concept

## Overview
Self concept refers to the collection of beliefs, perceptions, and feelings that individuals have about themselves. It is a central topic in psychology and sociology, influencing behavior, motivation, and mental health. On the MCAT, understanding self concept and its related constructs is essential for analyzing social behavior, identity, and psychological well-being.

## Components of Self Concept
- **Self-Schema:** Cognitive framework about oneself, guiding information processing.
- **Self-Esteem:** One’s overall sense of self-worth or personal value.
- **Self-Efficacy:** Belief in one’s ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish tasks (Bandura).
- **Self-Identity:** The way individuals define themselves, including personal and social identities.
- **Self-Awareness:** Conscious knowledge of one’s own character, feelings, motives, and desires.

## Development of Self Concept
- **Socialization:** Family, peers, culture, and media shape self concept through feedback and expectations.
- **Looking-Glass Self (Cooley):** Self develops through how we think others perceive us.
- **Role-Taking (Mead):** Understanding others’ perspectives helps develop the self.
- **Reference Groups:** Groups we compare ourselves to when evaluating our own qualities.

## Related Constructs
- **Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner):** Self concept is partly derived from group memberships (e.g., ethnicity, gender, profession).
- **Personal Identity:** Unique personal attributes (e.g., personality traits, abilities).
- **Social Identity:** Aspects of self derived from group membership.
- **Identity vs. Role Confusion (Erikson):** Adolescence is a key period for identity formation.

## Self and Behavior
- **Self-Discrepancy Theory:** Discrepancies between actual, ideal, and ought selves can affect emotions and motivation.
- **Locus of Control:** Belief about whether outcomes are controlled by internal or external factors.
- **Impression Management:** Strategies used to influence how others perceive us (Goffman’s dramaturgical approach).

## MCAT Connections
