# Eukaryotes

## Overview
Eukaryotes are organisms whose cells contain a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. They include animals, plants, fungi, and protists. Their compartmentalization and complexity are key for multicellularity and specialization, and are highly relevant for the MCAT.

## 1. Classification
- **Kingdoms:** Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista
- **Cell types:** Unicellular (protists, some fungi) and multicellular (animals, plants, most fungi)

---

## 2. Cell Structure
- **Nucleus:** Membrane-bound, contains linear chromosomes with histones
- **Membrane-bound organelles:**
  - **Mitochondria:** ATP production (endosymbiotic origin)
  - **Endoplasmic reticulum (ER):**
    - Rough ER: protein synthesis (ribosomes)
    - Smooth ER: lipid synthesis, detoxification
  - **Golgi apparatus:** Protein modification, sorting, packaging
  - **Lysosomes:** Digestive enzymes for waste/recycling
  - **Peroxisomes:** Fatty acid oxidation, detoxification
  - **Chloroplasts:** Photosynthesis (plants, algae; endosymbiotic origin)
- **Cytoskeleton:** Microtubules, microfilaments, intermediate filaments (cell shape, transport, division)
- **Plasma membrane:** Phospholipid bilayer with proteins, cholesterol
- **Cell wall:** Present in plants (cellulose), fungi (chitin); absent in animals
- **Ribosomes:** 80S (cytoplasm/ER); 70S in mitochondria/chloroplasts

---

## 3. Genetic Organization & Expression
- **Multiple linear chromosomes** in nucleus
- **Introns and exons:** Genes interrupted by non-coding sequences (introns)
- **mRNA processing:** 5' cap, 3' poly-A tail, splicing
- **Transcription in nucleus, translation in cytoplasm**
- **Monocistronic mRNA:** One gene per mRNA

---

## 4. Reproduction & Genetic Exchange
- **Asexual:** Mitosis (identical daughter cells)
- **Sexual:** Meiosis (gamete formation), fertilization (zygote)
- **Genetic recombination:** Crossing over, independent assortment

---

## 5. Energy & Metabolism
- **Mitochondria:** Aerobic respiration (ATP production)
- **Chloroplasts:** Photosynthesis (plants, algae)
- **Diverse metabolism:** Heterotrophy (animals, fungi), autotrophy (plants, algae)

---

## 6. Special Features & Clinical Relevance
- **Compartmentalization:** Allows specialization, regulation, and efficiency
- **Endosymbiotic theory:** Mitochondria/chloroplasts evolved from prokaryotes
- **Pathogens:** Fungi (yeast, molds), protozoa (malaria, Giardia)
- **Cancer:** Uncontrolled mitosis in multicellular eukaryotes
- **Genetic diseases:** Splicing defects, mitochondrial disorders

## Quiz

**Q1: Which of the following is unique to eukaryotic cells?**
A) Peptidoglycan cell wall
B) Membrane-bound nucleus *[CORRECT]
C) Circular DNA
D) 70S ribosomes only
**Explanation:** Eukaryotes have a true, membrane-bound nucleus; prokaryotes do not.

**Q2: Where does transcription occur in eukaryotic cells?**
A) Cytoplasm
B) Nucleus *[CORRECT]
C) Mitochondria only
D) Cell wall
**Explanation:** Transcription occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells.

**Q3: What is the function of the Golgi apparatus?**
A) ATP production
B) Protein modification and sorting *[CORRECT]
C) DNA replication
D) Lipid synthesis
**Explanation:** The Golgi modifies, sorts, and packages proteins for secretion or delivery.

**Q4: Which organelle is responsible for aerobic respiration in eukaryotes?**
A) Chloroplast
B) Mitochondrion *[CORRECT]
C) Lysosome
D) Nucleus
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the site of aerobic respiration and ATP production.

**Q5: Which of the following is a feature of eukaryotic gene expression?**
A) Polycistronic mRNA
B) Coupled transcription and translation
C) mRNA splicing *[CORRECT]
D) No introns
**Explanation:** Eukaryotic genes contain introns and require splicing to produce mature mRNA.
