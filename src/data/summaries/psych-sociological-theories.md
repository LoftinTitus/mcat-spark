# Sociological Theories

## Overview
Sociological theories are frameworks for understanding how society operates, how individuals interact, and how social structures influence behavior. The MCAT emphasizes the major theoretical perspectives, their key concepts, and their application to real-world scenarios and research. Mastery of these theories is essential for analyzing passages and experimental data in the Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations section.

## Major Sociological Theories

### 1. Functionalism (Structural Functionalism)
- **Key Idea:** Society is a complex system with interdependent parts working together to promote stability and order.
- **Founders:** Emile Durkheim, Talcott Parsons
- **Concepts:** Manifest functions (intended), latent functions (unintended), dysfunctions
- **MCAT Relevance:** Social institutions (family, education, religion) serve functions that maintain social equilibrium.

### 2. Conflict Theory
- **Key Idea:** Society is composed of groups competing for limited resources and power, leading to conflict and change.
- **Founders:** Karl Marx, Max Weber
- **Concepts:** Class struggle, power, inequality, exploitation
- **MCAT Relevance:** Social inequality, healthcare disparities, class conflict, feminist theory (gender inequality)

### 3. Symbolic Interactionism
- **Key Idea:** Society is built through everyday interactions and the meanings individuals assign to symbols, language, and actions.
- **Founders:** George Herbert Mead, Herbert Blumer
- **Concepts:** Symbols, social construction of reality, labeling, dramaturgy (Goffman)
- **MCAT Relevance:** Doctor-patient interactions, stigma, self-concept, social identity

### 4. Social Constructionism
- **Key Idea:** Reality is constructed through shared understandings, language, and social processes.
- **Concepts:** Social constructs (race, gender, illness), knowledge as a product of social context
- **MCAT Relevance:** Medicalization, definitions of health/illness, gender roles, race as a social construct

### 5. Exchange-Rational Choice Theory
- **Key Idea:** Individuals make decisions by weighing costs and benefits to maximize personal advantage.
- **Concepts:** Rational action, cost-benefit analysis, reciprocity
- **MCAT Relevance:** Health behaviors, economic decisions, social relationships

### 6. Feminist Theory
- **Key Idea:** Examines gender inequality and the social structures that perpetuate it.
- **Concepts:** Patriarchy, intersectionality, gender roles, oppression
- **MCAT Relevance:** Gender disparities in health, workplace, education, intersectionality (overlapping identities)

## MCAT Connections
- **Application:** Theories are used to interpret research findings, design studies, and explain social phenomena.
- **Multiple perspectives:** The same issue (e.g., healthcare inequality) can be analyzed through different theoretical lenses.
- **Critical thinking:** Recognize strengths and limitations of each theory.
