# Lymphatic System: Structure, Function, and MCAT Relevance

## Overview
The lymphatic system is a network of vessels, organs, and tissues that helps maintain fluid balance, supports immune defense, and absorbs dietary fats. Its structure and function are important for MCAT physiology and immunology.

## 1. Structure of the Lymphatic System
- **Lymph:**
  - Clear fluid derived from interstitial fluid; contains water, proteins, immune cells
- **Lymphatic Vessels:**
  - Thin-walled vessels that collect lymph from tissues and return it to the bloodstream
  - Have valves to prevent backflow; movement aided by skeletal muscle contraction
- **Lymph Nodes:**
  - Small, bean-shaped structures along vessels; filter lymph and house immune cells (lymphocytes, macrophages)
- **Major Organs:**
  - **Spleen:** Filters blood, removes old RBCs, stores platelets, initiates immune responses
  - **Thymus:** Site of T cell maturation (most active in childhood)
  - **Tonsils/Adenoids:** Protect against pathogens entering via mouth/nose
  - **Peyer’s Patches:** Lymphoid tissue in small intestine; monitors gut pathogens

## 2. Functions of the Lymphatic System
- **Fluid Balance:**
  - Returns excess interstitial fluid to the bloodstream, preventing edema
- **Immune Defense:**
  - Filters lymph; exposes pathogens to lymphocytes and macrophages
  - Initiates adaptive immune responses
- **Fat Absorption:**
  - Lacteals (specialized lymphatic vessels in intestines) absorb dietary fats and transport them as chylomicrons

---

## 3. Lymph Flow and Circulation
- Lymph flows from tissues → lymphatic capillaries → larger vessels → lymph nodes → thoracic duct/right lymphatic duct → subclavian veins (bloodstream)
- **Thoracic Duct:** Drains most of the body’s lymph into left subclavian vein
- **Right Lymphatic Duct:** Drains right upper body into right subclavian vein

---

## 4. Clinical and MCAT Relevance
- **Lymphedema:** Swelling due to lymphatic obstruction
- **Infection:** Swollen, tender lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy)
- **Cancer Metastasis:** Cancer cells can spread via lymphatic vessels
- **Splenectomy:** Increased infection risk due to loss of blood filtration
- **HIV/AIDS:** Targets lymphatic tissues, impairs immune function

## Quiz

**Q1: What is the main function of lymph nodes?**
A) Absorb dietary fats
B) Filter lymph and house immune cells *[CORRECT]
C) Produce red blood cells
D) Store platelets
**Explanation:** Lymph nodes filter lymph and are sites for immune cell activation.

**Q2: Which organ is the site of T cell maturation?**
A) Spleen
B) Thymus *[CORRECT]
C) Tonsils
D) Liver
**Explanation:** The thymus is where T cells mature, especially during childhood.

**Q3: What is the role of lacteals in the lymphatic system?**
A) Filter blood
B) Absorb dietary fats *[CORRECT]
C) Store lymphocytes
D) Produce antibodies
**Explanation:** Lacteals absorb fats from the intestine and transport them as chylomicrons.

**Q4: Where does the thoracic duct drain lymph?**
A) Right subclavian vein
B) Left subclavian vein *[CORRECT]
C) Superior vena cava
D) Aorta
**Explanation:** The thoracic duct drains lymph into the left subclavian vein.

**Q5: What condition results from lymphatic obstruction?**
A) Anemia
B) Lymphedema *[CORRECT]
C) Leukemia
D) Hemophilia
**Explanation:** Lymphedema is swelling caused by impaired lymphatic drainage.
