## Learning and Memory

### Classical Conditioning (Pavlov)
- Unconditioned stimulus (US) → Unconditioned response (UR)
- US + Neutral stimulus → Conditioned stimulus (CS)
- CS → Conditioned response (CR)

**Key Terms:**
- Acquisition: learning the association
- Extinction: CR fades without US
- Spontaneous recovery: CR returns after rest
- Generalization: respond to similar stimuli
- Discrimination: distinguish between stimuli

### Operant Conditioning (Skinner)
| Type | Effect | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Positive reinforcement | Add good → ↑ behavior | Give treat |
| Negative reinforcement | Remove bad → ↑ behavior | Stop alarm |
| Positive punishment | Add bad → ↓ behavior | Give detention |
| Negative punishment | Remove good → ↓ behavior | Take phone |

### Memory Types
**Sensory Memory**
- Iconic (visual): ~0.5 sec
- Echoic (auditory): ~3-4 sec

**Short-term/Working Memory**
- ~20 sec, 7±2 items
- Maintenance rehearsal keeps info

**Long-term Memory**
- Explicit (declarative): episodic, semantic
- Implicit (non-declarative): procedural, priming
