## Learning and Memory 

### Classical Conditioning (Pavlov)
- **Unconditioned stimulus (US):** naturally elicits a response (e.g., food)
- **Unconditioned response (UR):** natural response to US (e.g., salivation)
- **Neutral stimulus:** does not elicit response (e.g., bell)
- **Conditioned stimulus (CS):** previously neutral, now elicits response after association (e.g., bell after pairing)
- **Conditioned response (CR):** learned response to CS (e.g., salivation to bell)

**Key Terms:**
- **Acquisition:** learning the association between CS and US
- **Extinction:** CR fades when CS is presented without US
- **Spontaneous recovery:** CR returns after a rest period
- **Generalization:** CR to stimuli similar to CS
- **Discrimination:** ability to distinguish between CS and other stimuli
- **Higher-order conditioning:** CS paired with new neutral stimulus to create new CS

### Operant Conditioning (Skinner)
- **Behavior shaped by consequences (reinforcement or punishment)**
- **Reinforcement:** increases behavior
- **Punishment:** decreases behavior
- **Positive:** add stimulus; **Negative:** remove stimulus

| Type | Effect | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Positive reinforcement | Add good → ↑ behavior | Give treat |
| Negative reinforcement | Remove bad → ↑ behavior | Stop alarm |
| Positive punishment | Add bad → ↓ behavior | Give detention |
| Negative punishment | Remove good → ↓ behavior | Take phone |

**Key Concepts:**
- **Shaping:** reinforcing successive approximations toward a target behavior
- **Primary reinforcers:** naturally rewarding (food, water)
- **Secondary reinforcers:** learned value (money, praise)
- **Schedules of reinforcement:**
  - Fixed ratio: reward after set number of responses
  - Variable ratio: reward after unpredictable number (most resistant to extinction)
  - Fixed interval: reward after set time
  - Variable interval: reward after unpredictable time

### Observational Learning (Bandura)
- **Learning by watching others (modeling)**
- **Vicarious reinforcement/punishment:** observing consequences for others influences own behavior
- **Bobo doll experiment:** children imitate aggressive behavior

### Memory Types
**Sensory Memory**
- **Iconic (visual):** ~0.5 sec
- **Echoic (auditory):** ~3-4 sec

**Short-term/Working Memory**
- **Duration:** ~20 sec, **Capacity:** 7±2 items
- **Maintenance rehearsal:** keeps info in short-term
- **Chunking:** grouping info increases capacity

**Long-term Memory**
- **Explicit (declarative):**
  - **Episodic:** personal experiences
  - **Semantic:** facts, general knowledge
- **Implicit (non-declarative):**
  - **Procedural:** skills, habits (e.g., riding a bike)
  - **Priming:** exposure influences response
  - **Classical conditioning:** learned associations

**Encoding:**
- **Elaborative rehearsal:** linking new info to existing knowledge
- **Mnemonic devices:** memory aids (acronyms, imagery)

**Retrieval:**
- **Recall:** retrieving info without cues
- **Recognition:** identifying info with cues
- **Relearning:** faster reacquisition of forgotten info

**Forgetting:**
- **Decay:** memory fades over time
- **Interference:**
  - **Proactive:** old info interferes with new
  - **Retroactive:** new info interferes with old

## Quiz

**Q1: In classical conditioning, what is the conditioned response (CR)?**
A) The natural response to the unconditioned stimulus
B) The learned response to the conditioned stimulus *[CORRECT]
C) The stimulus that naturally elicits a response
D) The process of pairing two stimuli
**Explanation:** The CR is the learned response to the previously neutral (now conditioned) stimulus.

**Q2: Which reinforcement schedule is most resistant to extinction?**
A) Fixed ratio
B) Variable ratio *[CORRECT]
C) Fixed interval
D) Continuous
**Explanation:** Variable ratio schedules (e.g., gambling) are most resistant to extinction because rewards are unpredictable.

**Q3: Which type of memory is responsible for remembering how to ride a bicycle?**
A) Semantic
B) Episodic
C) Procedural *[CORRECT]
D) Sensory
**Explanation:** Procedural memory (a type of implicit memory) stores skills and habits.

**Q4: What is the effect called when old information interferes with learning new information?**
A) Retroactive interference
B) Proactive interference *[CORRECT]
C) Decay
D) Chunking
**Explanation:** Proactive interference is when old memories hinder the learning of new information.

**Q5: According to Bandura, what is required for observational learning to occur?**
A) Direct reinforcement
B) Punishment
C) Attention to a model *[CORRECT]
D) Classical conditioning
**Explanation:** Observational learning requires attention to a model, retention, reproduction, and motivation.
