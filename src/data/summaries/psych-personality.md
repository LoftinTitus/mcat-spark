# Personality

## Overview
Personality refers to the enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that distinguish individuals from one another. It is shaped by genetic, environmental, and social factors. On the MCAT, understanding major theories of personality, assessment methods, and the biological and social influences on personality is essential for analyzing psychological and behavioral scenarios.

## Major Theories of Personality

### 1. Psychoanalytic Theory (Freud)
- **Key Concepts:** Id, ego, superego; unconscious motives; psychosexual stages (oral, anal, phallic, latency, genital)
- **Defense Mechanisms:** Repression, denial, projection, displacement, sublimation
- **MCAT Relevance:** Role of unconscious, early childhood experiences, and defense mechanisms in behavior

### 2. Humanistic Theory (Rogers, Maslow)
- **Key Concepts:** Self-actualization, unconditional positive regard, self-concept
- **Hierarchy of Needs (Maslow):** Physiological → safety → love/belonging → esteem → self-actualization
- **MCAT Relevance:** Emphasis on personal growth, self-awareness, and fulfillment

### 3. Trait Theory
- **Key Concepts:** Personality consists of stable traits (characteristics)
- **Big Five (OCEAN):** Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism
- **MCAT Relevance:** Trait measurement, heritability, and stability across situations

### 4. Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura)
- **Key Concepts:** Reciprocal determinism (interaction of behavior, cognition, environment), observational learning, self-efficacy
- **MCAT Relevance:** Influence of environment and cognition on personality, modeling, and self-regulation

### 5. Biological Theory
- **Key Concepts:** Genetic and neurobiological basis of personality; temperament
- **Twin and adoption studies:** Heritability of traits
- **MCAT Relevance:** Role of genes, neurotransmitters, and brain structures in personality

### 6. Behaviorist Theory
- **Key Concepts:** Personality is shaped by learned behaviors through conditioning (classical and operant)
- **MCAT Relevance:** Environmental reinforcement and punishment, learning history

## Personality Assessment
- **Self-report inventories:** Questionnaires (e.g., MMPI, Big Five)
- **Projective tests:** Rorschach inkblot, Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)
- **Observational methods:** Behavioral assessment

## MCAT Connections
- **Application:** Personality influences health behaviors, coping, and mental health.
- **Research:** Used to interpret psychological experiments and clinical scenarios.
- **Critical Thinking:** Recognize the strengths and limitations of each theory.
