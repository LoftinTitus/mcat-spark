# Renal Regulation of Blood Flow, Pressure, and pH

The kidneys play a central role in maintaining homeostasis by regulating blood flow, blood pressure, and acid-base balance (pH). These functions are essential for survival and are frequently tested on the MCAT.

## Blood Flow Regulation
- **Renal Blood Flow:** Kidneys receive ~20% of cardiac output. Blood enters via the renal artery, branches into afferent arterioles, and is filtered in the glomerulus.
- **Autoregulation:** The kidneys maintain stable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) despite fluctuations in systemic blood pressure. Key mechanisms:
  - **Myogenic Response:** Smooth muscle in afferent arteriole constricts when blood pressure rises, dilates when it falls.
  - **Tubuloglomerular Feedback:** Macula densa cells sense NaCl in distal tubule; high NaCl triggers afferent arteriole constriction to reduce GFR.

## Blood Pressure Regulation
- **Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS):**
  - **Renin Release:** Juxtaglomerular cells secrete renin in response to low blood pressure, low Na+, or sympathetic stimulation.
  - **Angiotensin II:** Potent vasoconstrictor; increases systemic blood pressure and stimulates aldosterone release.
  - **Aldosterone:** Promotes Na+ and water reabsorption in distal nephron, increasing blood volume and pressure.
- **Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH):** Released from posterior pituitary in response to high plasma osmolality or low blood pressure; increases water reabsorption in collecting duct.
- **Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP):** Released from atria in response to high blood volume; promotes Na+ and water excretion, lowering blood pressure.

## Acid-Base (pH) Regulation
- **Bicarbonate Reabsorption:** Kidneys reabsorb filtered HCO3- in the proximal tubule and generate new HCO3- in the distal nephron.
- **Hydrogen Ion Secretion:** Tubular cells secrete H+ into urine, especially in distal tubule and collecting duct.
- **Ammonium Excretion:** Kidneys excrete NH4+ to remove excess acid.
- **Compensation:** In metabolic acidosis, kidneys increase H+ secretion and HCO3- reabsorption; in alkalosis, they decrease H+ secretion and excrete more HCO3-.

## Clinical Relevance
- **Hypertension:** Chronic high blood pressure can damage renal vessels, impairing regulation.
- **Renal Tubular Acidosis:** Defects in acid secretion or bicarbonate reabsorption lead to metabolic acidosis.
- **Heart Failure:** RAAS activation can worsen fluid overload and hypertension.
- **Diuretics:** Drugs that alter renal handling of Na+, water, or H+ can affect blood pressure and pH.

## Quiz

**Q1: Which hormone increases sodium reabsorption and raises blood pressure?**
A) ADH
B) Aldosterone *[CORRECT]
C) ANP
D) Renin
**Explanation:** Aldosterone increases Na+ reabsorption in the distal nephron, raising blood volume and pressure.

**Q2: What is the primary renal mechanism for compensating metabolic acidosis?**
A) Decrease H+ secretion
B) Increase HCO3- reabsorption and H+ secretion *[CORRECT]
C) Increase NH4+ reabsorption
D) Decrease water reabsorption
**Explanation:** Kidneys compensate by increasing H+ secretion and HCO3- reabsorption.

**Q3: The myogenic response in renal autoregulation involves:**
A) Macula densa sensing NaCl
B) Smooth muscle constriction in afferent arteriole *[CORRECT]
C) Renin release
D) Aldosterone secretion
**Explanation:** The myogenic response is the constriction/dilation of afferent arteriole smooth muscle in response to pressure changes.

**Q4: Which peptide hormone promotes sodium and water excretion to lower blood pressure?**
A) Renin
B) Angiotensin II
C) ANP *[CORRECT]
D) ADH
**Explanation:** ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) promotes natriuresis and diuresis, lowering blood pressure.

**Q5: In renal regulation of acid-base balance, which process removes excess acid from the body?**
A) Bicarbonate reabsorption
B) Hydrogen ion secretion *[CORRECT]
C) Sodium reabsorption
D) Water excretion
**Explanation:** Secretion of H+ into urine is the main way kidneys remove excess acid and regulate pH.
