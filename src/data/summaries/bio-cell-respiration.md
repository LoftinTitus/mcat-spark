## Cellular Respiration (MCAT Focus)

### Overview
- **Equation:** Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) + 6 O₂ → 6 CO₂ + 6 H₂O + ~30-32 ATP
- **Purpose:** Extract energy from glucose to produce ATP, the cell's energy currency.
- **MCAT Tip:** Know where each step occurs, what goes in/out, and key regulatory enzymes.

### 1. Glycolysis (Cytoplasm)
- **Reactant:** Glucose
- **Products:** 2 Pyruvate, 2 ATP (net), 2 NADH
- **Anaerobic:** Does not require O₂
- **Key Enzyme:** Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) — rate-limiting, allosterically regulated by ATP, citrate, AMP
- **MCAT Note:** Only pathway that can occur without mitochondria (e.g., RBCs)

### 2. Pyruvate Oxidation (Mitochondrial Matrix)
- **Reactant:** 2 Pyruvate (from glycolysis)
- **Products:** 2 Acetyl-CoA, 2 NADH, 2 CO₂
- **Enzyme:** Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH)
- **Regulation:** Inhibited by acetyl-CoA, NADH, ATP
- **MCAT Note:** PDH deficiency → lactic acidosis

### 3. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs, TCA) (Matrix)
- **Reactant:** 2 Acetyl-CoA
- **Products (per glucose):** 6 NADH, 2 FADH₂, 2 GTP (→ ATP), 4 CO₂
- **Key Enzymes:** Isocitrate dehydrogenase (rate-limiting), α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
- **MCAT Note:** Intermediates used for biosynthesis (e.g., α-KG for amino acids)

### 4. Electron Transport Chain & Oxidative Phosphorylation (Inner Mitochondrial Membrane)
- **Electron Donors:** NADH, FADH₂
- **ATP Yield:** NADH → 2.5 ATP, FADH₂ → 1.5 ATP
- **O₂:** Final electron acceptor → H₂O
- **Proton Gradient:** Drives ATP synthase
- **MCAT Note:** Cyanide inhibits Complex IV; oligomycin inhibits ATP synthase; uncouplers (DNP) dissipate gradient → heat, no ATP

### MCAT High-Yield Points
- **Location:** Know where each step occurs (cytoplasm vs. mitochondria)
- **Regulation:** Allosteric regulators of PFK-1, PDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase
- **Anaerobic vs. Aerobic:** Glycolysis is anaerobic; rest require O₂
- **Clinical:** Inhibitors, deficiencies, and their effects (e.g., lactic acidosis, poisons)

## Quiz

**Q1: Where does glycolysis occur in the cell?**
A) Mitochondrial matrix  
B) Cytoplasm *[CORRECT]*  
C) Inner mitochondrial membrane  
D) Nucleus  
**Explanation:** Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of all cells, including those without mitochondria (e.g., red blood cells).

**Q2: Which enzyme is the rate-limiting step of glycolysis?**
A) Hexokinase  
B) Pyruvate kinase  
C) Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) *[CORRECT]*  
D) Isocitrate dehydrogenase  
**Explanation:** PFK-1 is the main regulatory and rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, allosterically inhibited by ATP and citrate.

**Q3: What is the main role of oxygen in cellular respiration?**
A) Substrate for glycolysis  
B) Final electron acceptor in the ETC *[CORRECT]*  
C) Activator of PDH  
D) Inhibitor of ATP synthase  
**Explanation:** Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, allowing for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production.

**Q4: A patient with PDH deficiency is most likely to develop which condition?**
A) Hyperglycemia  
B) Lactic acidosis *[CORRECT]*  
C) Hypoxia  
D) Ketoacidosis  
**Explanation:** PDH deficiency impairs conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, causing pyruvate to be shunted to lactate, resulting in lactic acidosis.

**Q5: Which of the following poisons inhibits ATP synthase?**
A) Cyanide  
B) Oligomycin *[CORRECT]*  
C) DNP (dinitrophenol)  
D) Rotenone  
**Explanation:** Oligomycin directly inhibits ATP synthase, preventing ATP production from the proton gradient.
