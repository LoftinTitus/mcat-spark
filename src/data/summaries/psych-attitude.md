# Attitude

## Overview
Attitude is a psychological tendency expressed by evaluating a particular entity with some degree of favor or disfavor. Attitudes influence thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and are central to understanding social psychology. On the MCAT, knowledge of attitude structure, formation, change, and the relationship between attitudes and behavior is essential for analyzing social and behavioral scenarios.

## Components of Attitude (ABC Model)
- **Affective Component:** Emotional response or feelings toward an object, person, or situation (e.g., fear of snakes).
- **Behavioral Component:** How attitude influences actions or behavior (e.g., avoiding snakes).
- **Cognitive Component:** Beliefs or thoughts about the object (e.g., snakes are dangerous).

## Formation of Attitudes
- **Learning:** Classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning (modeling).
- **Socialization:** Family, peers, media, and culture shape attitudes.
- **Mere Exposure Effect:** Repeated exposure increases liking.

## Attitude and Behavior
- **Theory of Planned Behavior:** Behavior is predicted by intention, which is influenced by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control.
- **Attitude-Behavior Consistency:** Stronger when attitudes are specific, accessible, and important to the individual.
- **Cognitive Dissonance Theory (Festinger):** Inconsistency between attitudes and behaviors creates discomfort, motivating attitude or behavior change.
- **Self-Perception Theory:** People infer their attitudes from their own behavior, especially when attitudes are weak or ambiguous.

## Attitude Change
- **Persuasion:** Process of changing attitudes through communication.
  - **Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM):**
    - **Central route:** Careful, thoughtful consideration of arguments (high motivation/ability).
    - **Peripheral route:** Superficial cues (e.g., attractiveness, credibility) (low motivation/ability).
- **Social Influence:** Conformity, compliance, obedience can alter attitudes.

## MCAT Connections
- **Application:** Attitudes affect health behaviors, prejudice, and decision-making.
- **Research:** Used to interpret experiments on persuasion, conformity, and cognitive dissonance.
- **Critical Thinking:** Recognize the interplay between attitudes, behavior, and social context.

**Q4: In the elaboration likelihood model, which route to persuasion involves careful consideration of arguments?**
A) Peripheral route
B) Central route *[CORRECT]
C) Emotional route
D) Social route
