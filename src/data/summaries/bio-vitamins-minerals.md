# Vitamins and Minerals: MCAT Review

Vitamins and minerals are essential micronutrients required for numerous biochemical and physiological processes. They support metabolism, growth, immunity, and cellular function. MCAT questions often focus on their types, functions, deficiencies, and clinical relevance.

## Vitamins
- **Fat-Soluble Vitamins:**
  - **Vitamin A (Retinol):** Vision (retinal), epithelial cell health, immune function. Deficiency: night blindness, keratinization.
  - **Vitamin D (Calciferol):** Calcium/phosphate absorption, bone health. Deficiency: rickets (children), osteomalacia (adults).
  - **Vitamin E (Tocopherol):** Antioxidant, protects cell membranes. Deficiency: hemolytic anemia, neuropathy.
  - **Vitamin K:** Blood clotting (coagulation factors), bone metabolism. Deficiency: bleeding disorders.
- **Water-Soluble Vitamins:**
  - **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid):** Collagen synthesis, antioxidant, iron absorption. Deficiency: scurvy.
  - **B Vitamins:**
    - **B1 (Thiamine):** Carbohydrate metabolism, nerve function. Deficiency: beriberi, Wernicke-Korsakoff.
    - **B2 (Riboflavin):** Energy production, skin/eye health. Deficiency: cheilosis, glossitis.
    - **B3 (Niacin):** NAD/NADP coenzyme, energy metabolism. Deficiency: pellagra (dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia).
    - **B6 (Pyridoxine):** Amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis. Deficiency: anemia, neuropathy.
    - **B9 (Folate):** DNA synthesis, cell division. Deficiency: megaloblastic anemia, neural tube defects.
    - **B12 (Cobalamin):** DNA synthesis, nerve function. Deficiency: pernicious anemia, neuropathy.
    - **Biotin:** Carboxylation reactions. Deficiency: dermatitis, alopecia.
    - **Pantothenic Acid:** Coenzyme A synthesis. Deficiency: rare, fatigue.

## Minerals
- **Major Minerals:**
  - **Calcium:** Bone/teeth structure, muscle contraction, nerve signaling, blood clotting. Deficiency: osteoporosis, tetany.
  - **Phosphorus:** Bone/teeth, ATP, nucleic acids. Deficiency: weakness, bone pain.
  - **Magnesium:** Enzyme cofactor, muscle/nerve function. Deficiency: muscle cramps, arrhythmias.
  - **Sodium:** Fluid balance, nerve/muscle function. Deficiency: hyponatremia (confusion, seizures).
  - **Potassium:** Nerve/muscle function, acid-base balance. Deficiency: arrhythmias, muscle weakness.
  - **Chloride:** Fluid balance, gastric acid (HCl). Deficiency: metabolic alkalosis.
- **Trace Minerals:**
  - **Iron:** Hemoglobin/myoglobin, oxygen transport. Deficiency: anemia, fatigue.
  - **Zinc:** Enzyme function, immune system, wound healing. Deficiency: growth retardation, impaired immunity.
  - **Copper:** Iron metabolism, connective tissue. Deficiency: anemia, bone abnormalities.
  - **Iodine:** Thyroid hormone synthesis. Deficiency: goiter, hypothyroidism.
  - **Selenium:** Antioxidant enzymes. Deficiency: cardiomyopathy.
  - **Fluoride:** Tooth enamel strength. Deficiency: dental caries.

## Clinical Relevance
- **Deficiencies:** Can result from poor diet, malabsorption, or increased requirements (pregnancy, illness).
- **Toxicities:** Excess intake (supplements) can cause adverse effects (e.g., hypervitaminosis A, iron overload).
- **Special Populations:** Infants, elderly, pregnant women, and those with chronic diseases may have unique needs.
