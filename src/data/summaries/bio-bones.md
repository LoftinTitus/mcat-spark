## Bones: Structure and Function

### Overview
Bones are rigid organs forming the skeleton, providing support, protection, movement, mineral storage, and blood cell production. They are dynamic tissues, constantly remodeled throughout life.

### Bone Structure
- **Gross Anatomy:**
  - **Long bones:** (e.g., femur, humerus) have a shaft (diaphysis), ends (epiphyses), and a growth plate (metaphysis).
  - **Short, flat, irregular bones:** (e.g., vertebrae, skull, pelvis) vary in shape and function.
- **Microscopic Anatomy:**
  - **Compact (cortical) bone:** Dense, strong outer layer; provides strength.
  - **Spongy (cancellous) bone:** Porous, inner layer; contains red marrow.
  - **Osteon (Haversian system):** Functional unit of compact bone; concentric lamellae around a central canal.
  - **Bone cells:**
    - **Osteoblasts:** Build bone (bone formation)
    - **Osteocytes:** Mature bone cells, maintain bone
    - **Osteoclasts:** Break down bone (bone resorption)

### Bone Matrix
- **Organic component:** Collagen fibers (flexibility, tensile strength)
- **Inorganic component:** Hydroxyapatite (calcium phosphate crystals; hardness)

### Bone Marrow
- **Red marrow:** Hematopoiesis (blood cell formation); found in spongy bone of flat bones and epiphyses of long bones
- **Yellow marrow:** Fat storage; found in medullary cavity of long bones

### Bone Growth and Remodeling
- **Endochondral ossification:** Most bones form from cartilage templates
- **Intramembranous ossification:** Flat bones form directly from mesenchyme
- **Remodeling:** Continuous process; osteoblasts and osteoclasts respond to mechanical stress, hormones (PTH, calcitonin, vitamin D)

### Functions of Bone
- **Support:** Framework for body
- **Protection:** Shields organs (e.g., skull, ribcage)
- **Movement:** Leverage for muscles
- **Mineral storage:** Reservoir for calcium, phosphate
- **Blood cell production:** Red marrow
- **Fat storage:** Yellow marrow
- **Endocrine function:** Osteocalcin (regulates glucose metabolism)

### Clinical Relevance (MCAT Focus)
- **Osteoporosis:** Decreased bone mass, increased fracture risk (postmenopausal women, aging)
- **Rickets/Osteomalacia:** Vitamin D deficiency, defective mineralization
- **Paget's disease:** Abnormal bone remodeling
- **Fracture healing:** Hematoma, callus formation, remodeling
- **Hormonal regulation:** PTH (increases blood Ca²⁺), calcitonin (decreases blood Ca²⁺), vitamin D (increases Ca²⁺ absorption)

## Quiz

**Q1: What is the primary mineral component that gives bone its hardness?**
A) Collagen
B) Hydroxyapatite *[CORRECT]
C) Elastin
D) Keratin
**Explanation:** Hydroxyapatite (calcium phosphate crystals) is the main inorganic component responsible for bone hardness.

**Q2: Which bone cell type is responsible for bone resorption?**
A) Osteoblast
B) Osteocyte
C) Osteoclast *[CORRECT]
D) Chondrocyte
**Explanation:** Osteoclasts break down bone tissue during remodeling and resorption.

**Q3: Where does hematopoiesis primarily occur in adults?**
A) Yellow marrow
B) Compact bone
C) Red marrow *[CORRECT]
D) Periosteum
**Explanation:** Red marrow in spongy bone is the main site of blood cell formation in adults.

**Q4: Which hormone increases blood calcium levels by stimulating bone resorption?**
A) Calcitonin
B) Parathyroid hormone (PTH) *[CORRECT]
C) Insulin
D) Growth hormone
**Explanation:** PTH stimulates osteoclasts to break down bone, releasing calcium into the blood.

**Q5: What process forms most bones from cartilage templates during development?**
A) Intramembranous ossification
B) Endochondral ossification *[CORRECT]
C) Appositional growth
D) Bone remodeling
**Explanation:** Endochondral ossification is the process by which most bones develop from cartilage models.
