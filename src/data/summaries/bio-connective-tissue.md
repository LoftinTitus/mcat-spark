# Connective Tissue: MCAT Review

Connective tissue is a diverse group of tissues that support, bind, and protect organs and other tissues in the body. It is characterized by cells embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM) and is essential for structural integrity, transport, and immune defense. MCAT questions often focus on types, components, functions, and clinical relevance.

## Components
- **Cells:**
  - **Fibroblasts:** Synthesize ECM (collagen, elastin, glycoproteins).
  - **Adipocytes:** Store fat (energy reserve, insulation).
  - **Chondrocytes:** Cartilage cells.
  - **Osteocytes:** Bone cells.
  - **Macrophages, Mast Cells, Plasma Cells:** Immune defense.
- **Extracellular Matrix (ECM):**
  - **Fibers:**
    - **Collagen:** Provides tensile strength.
    - **Elastin:** Provides elasticity.
    - **Reticular fibers:** Support for soft tissues.
  - **Ground Substance:** Proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), water; fills spaces, resists compression.

## Types of Connective Tissue
- **Loose Connective Tissue:**
  - **Areolar:** Most common; supports epithelia, surrounds blood vessels.
  - **Adipose:** Fat storage, insulation, cushioning.
  - **Reticular:** Supports lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes).
- **Dense Connective Tissue:**
  - **Dense Regular:** Parallel collagen fibers; tendons, ligaments (high tensile strength).
  - **Dense Irregular:** Random collagen fibers; dermis, organ capsules (resists multidirectional stress).
- **Specialized Connective Tissue:**
  - **Cartilage:** Hyaline, elastic, fibrocartilage (support, flexibility, shock absorption).
  - **Bone:** Rigid support, mineral storage, hematopoiesis.
  - **Blood:** Fluid connective tissue; transport, immunity, clotting.

## Functions
- **Support and Protection:** Framework for organs, protection from injury.
- **Binding and Packing:** Connects tissues, fills spaces.
- **Transport:** Blood transports gases, nutrients, wastes.
- **Energy Storage:** Adipose tissue stores triglycerides.
- **Immune Defense:** Macrophages, mast cells, plasma cells respond to pathogens.

## Clinical Relevance
- **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome:** Defective collagen synthesis; hyperflexible joints, fragile skin.
- **Osteogenesis Imperfecta:** Brittle bone disease; abnormal collagen in bone.
- **Obesity:** Excess adipose tissue; metabolic and cardiovascular risks.
- **Scurvy:** Vitamin C deficiency impairs collagen synthesis; weak connective tissue.
- **Edema:** Excess fluid in connective tissue spaces.

## Quiz

**Q1: Which cell type is primarily responsible for synthesizing collagen in connective tissue?**
A) Chondrocyte
B) Fibroblast *[CORRECT]
C) Adipocyte
D) Osteocyte
**Explanation:** Fibroblasts produce collagen, elastin, and other ECM components.

**Q2: What is the main function of adipose tissue?**
A) Blood cell formation
B) Fat storage and insulation *[CORRECT]
C) Elasticity
D) Immune defense
**Explanation:** Adipose tissue stores triglycerides and insulates/cushions organs.

**Q3: Which connective tissue type forms tendons and ligaments?**
A) Loose areolar
B) Dense regular *[CORRECT]
C) Dense irregular
D) Reticular
**Explanation:** Dense regular connective tissue has parallel collagen fibers for high tensile strength.

**Q4: What is the main protein providing elasticity in connective tissue?**
A) Collagen
B) Elastin *[CORRECT]
C) Keratin
D) Fibrin
**Explanation:** Elastin allows tissues to stretch and recoil.

**Q5: Which disease results from defective collagen synthesis?**
A) Scurvy
B) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome *[CORRECT]
C) Osteoporosis
D) Obesity
**Explanation:** Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is caused by abnormal collagen, leading to hyperflexibility and fragile tissues.
