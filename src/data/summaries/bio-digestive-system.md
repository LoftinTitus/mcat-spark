# Digestive System: MCAT Review

The digestive system is responsible for breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating waste. It consists of the alimentary canal (GI tract) and accessory organs. MCAT questions often focus on anatomy, physiology, enzymatic processes, and regulation.

## Major Components
- **Oral Cavity:** Mechanical breakdown (chewing), chemical digestion (salivary amylase for starch).
- **Pharynx & Esophagus:** Swallowing and peristalsis move food to stomach.
- **Stomach:** Churns food, secretes gastric juice (HCl, pepsinogen). Pepsin digests proteins. Mucus protects lining.
- **Small Intestine:**
  - **Duodenum:** Receives chyme, bile (from liver/gallbladder), and pancreatic enzymes. Major site of chemical digestion.
  - **Jejunum & Ileum:** Absorb nutrients via villi and microvilli (increase surface area).
- **Large Intestine:** Absorbs water, electrolytes; forms feces. Houses gut microbiota.
- **Rectum & Anus:** Store and eliminate feces.

## Accessory Organs
- **Liver:** Produces bile, metabolizes nutrients, detoxifies blood, stores glycogen.
- **Gallbladder:** Stores and releases bile.
- **Pancreas:** Secretes digestive enzymes (amylase, lipase, proteases) and bicarbonate; endocrine function (insulin, glucagon).

## Digestive Processes
- **Ingestion:** Taking in food.
- **Digestion:** Mechanical and chemical breakdown.
- **Absorption:** Uptake of nutrients into blood/lymph.
- **Secretion:** Enzymes, acids, hormones.
- **Motility:** Peristalsis and segmentation.
- **Elimination:** Removal of undigested material.

## Regulation
- **Neural:** Enteric nervous system (local control), autonomic nervous system (parasympathetic stimulates, sympathetic inhibits).
- **Hormonal:** Gastrin (stimulates HCl), secretin (stimulates bicarbonate), cholecystokinin/CCK (stimulates bile/pancreatic enzyme release).

## Clinical Relevance
- **Peptic Ulcers:** Caused by H. pylori or NSAIDs; breakdown of mucosal barrier.
- **Malabsorption Syndromes:** Celiac disease, lactose intolerance.
- **Gallstones:** Block bile flow, cause pain and jaundice.
- **Pancreatitis:** Inflammation impairs digestion and absorption.

## Quiz

**Q1: Which enzyme begins carbohydrate digestion in the mouth?**
A) Pepsin
B) Salivary amylase *[CORRECT]
C) Pancreatic lipase
D) Trypsin
**Explanation:** Salivary amylase starts starch digestion in the oral cavity.

**Q2: What is the primary function of the villi in the small intestine?**
A) Secrete digestive enzymes
B) Increase surface area for absorption *[CORRECT]
C) Protect against pathogens
D) Store bile
**Explanation:** Villi and microvilli greatly increase absorptive surface area.

**Q3: Which hormone stimulates the release of bile and pancreatic enzymes?**
A) Gastrin
B) Secretin
C) Cholecystokinin (CCK) *[CORRECT]
D) Insulin
**Explanation:** CCK is released in response to fats/proteins in chyme, stimulating bile and enzyme secretion.

**Q4: What is the main function of the large intestine?**
A) Protein digestion
B) Absorption of water and electrolytes *[CORRECT]
C) Secretion of insulin
D) Breakdown of starch
**Explanation:** The large intestine absorbs water/electrolytes and forms feces.

**Q5: Which condition is caused by the breakdown of the stomach's mucosal barrier?**
A) Gallstones
B) Peptic ulcer *[CORRECT]
C) Pancreatitis
D) Lactose intolerance
**Explanation:** Peptic ulcers result from mucosal barrier breakdown, often due to H. pylori or NSAIDs.
