## Mendelian Genetics

### Overview
- Mendelian genetics explains how traits are inherited through discrete units (genes), as discovered by Gregor Mendel using pea plants.
- Each individual has two alleles for each gene, one from each parent.
- Alleles can be dominant or recessive, and their combinations determine genotype and phenotype.

### Key Laws of Mendelian Inheritance

#### 1. Law of Segregation
- Each gamete receives only one allele of each gene.
- During meiosis, homologous chromosomes (and thus alleles) separate so offspring inherit one allele from each parent.
- Explains the 3:1 ratio in monohybrid crosses (heterozygote self-cross).
- Applies to all sexually reproducing organisms.

#### 2. Law of Independent Assortment
- Genes for different traits assort independently if they are on different chromosomes (or far apart on the same chromosome).
- Explains the 9:3:3:1 ratio in dihybrid crosses (two genes, each with two alleles).
- Exception: Linked genes (close together on the same chromosome) do not assort independently unless crossing over occurs.

#### 3. Law of Dominance
- In heterozygotes, the dominant allele masks the effect of the recessive allele.
- Genotype: genetic makeup (e.g., AA, Aa, aa)
- Phenotype: observable trait (e.g., purple or white flower)
- Homozygous: two identical alleles (AA or aa)
- Heterozygous: two different alleles (Aa)

### Punnett Squares & Probability
- Visual tool to predict genotype and phenotype ratios in offspring.
- **Monohybrid cross:** 1 gene, 2 alleles (e.g., Aa x Aa)
  - Genotypic ratio: 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa
  - Phenotypic ratio (complete dominance): 3 dominant : 1 recessive
- **Dihybrid cross:** 2 genes (e.g., AaBb x AaBb)
  - Phenotypic ratio: 9:3:3:1 (if genes assort independently)
- **Test cross:** Cross unknown genotype with homozygous recessive to determine genotype.
- **Probability rules:**
  - Multiplication rule: probability of independent events both occurring (e.g., AaBb offspring = 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4)
  - Addition rule: probability of either event occurring (e.g., Aa or AA = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4)

### Extensions & Exceptions to Mendelian Inheritance
- **Incomplete dominance:** Heterozygote has intermediate phenotype (e.g., red x white = pink flowers)
- **Codominance:** Both alleles expressed (e.g., AB blood type)
- **Multiple alleles:** More than two possible alleles in population (e.g., ABO blood group)
- **Epistasis:** One gene affects expression of another (e.g., coat color in mice)
- **Pleiotropy:** One gene affects multiple traits (e.g., Marfan syndrome)
- **Polygenic inheritance:** Multiple genes contribute to a single trait (e.g., height, skin color)
- **Sex-linked inheritance:** Genes on sex chromosomes (X or Y); X-linked recessive traits more common in males (e.g., hemophilia, color blindness)
- **Gene linkage & recombination:** Linked genes inherited together unless crossing over occurs; recombination frequency used to map genes.

### MCAT High-Yield Points
- Know how to set up and interpret Punnett squares for mono- and dihybrid crosses.
- Be able to predict genotypic and phenotypic ratios.
- Recognize and distinguish between complete dominance, incomplete dominance, codominance, and sex-linkage.
- Understand exceptions: gene linkage, recombination, epistasis, pleiotropy, polygenic traits.
- Be able to apply probability rules to genetic crosses.
- Know examples of human genetic diseases illustrating these principles (e.g., cystic fibrosis = autosomal recessive, Huntington's = autosomal dominant, hemophilia = X-linked recessive).

## Quiz

**Q1: In a monohybrid cross (Aa x Aa) with complete dominance, what is the expected genotypic ratio in the F2 generation?**
A) 3:1
B) 1:2:1 *[CORRECT]
C) 9:3:3:1
D) 2:1
**Explanation:** The genotypic ratio is 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa in the F2 generation.

**Q2: Which of the following best describes codominance?**
A) Heterozygote shows an intermediate phenotype
B) Both alleles are fully expressed in the heterozygote *[CORRECT]
C) Only the dominant allele is expressed
D) The trait is only seen in males
**Explanation:** In codominance, both alleles are fully expressed (e.g., AB blood type).

**Q3: What is the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation of a dihybrid cross (AaBb x AaBb) if the genes assort independently?**
A) 3:1
B) 1:2:1
C) 9:3:3:1 *[CORRECT]
D) 1:1
**Explanation:** Independent assortment of two genes results in a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.

**Q4: A woman who is a carrier for an X-linked recessive disorder (X^NX^n) and a normal man (X^NY) have a son. What is the probability that the son will be affected?**
A) 0%
B) 25%
C) 50% *[CORRECT]
D) 100%
**Explanation:** Sons inherit their X chromosome from their mother; there is a 50% chance the son will inherit the affected X and be affected.

**Q5: Which of the following is an example of pleiotropy?**
A) A gene that affects only eye color
B) A gene that affects multiple traits, such as connective tissue, heart, and eyes *[CORRECT]
C) Two genes affecting the same trait
D) Genes located on the same chromosome
**Explanation:** Pleiotropy is when one gene influences multiple, seemingly unrelated traits (e.g., Marfan syndrome).
