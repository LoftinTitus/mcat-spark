## Genetics Essentials

### Central Dogma
DNA → RNA → Protein

### DNA Replication
- Semiconservative
- 5' to 3' synthesis
- Leading strand: continuous
- Lagging strand: Okazaki fragments
- Key enzymes: Helicase, Primase, DNA Pol III, Ligase

### Transcription
**Prokaryotes**: No processing needed
**Eukaryotes**: 
- 5' cap (7-methylguanosine)
- 3' poly-A tail
- Splicing (remove introns, keep exons)

### Translation
- Start codon: AUG (Met)
- Stop codons: UAA, UAG, UGA
- Wobble: 3rd position of codon less specific

### Mendelian Genetics
- Dominant masks recessive
- Law of Segregation: alleles separate in meiosis
- Law of Independent Assortment: genes on different chromosomes

### Non-Mendelian Patterns
- Incomplete dominance: heterozygote intermediate
- Codominance: both alleles expressed (blood types)
- X-linked: more common in males
- Epistasis: one gene affects another
