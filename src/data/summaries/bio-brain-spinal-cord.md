# Brain and Spinal Cord: Structure and Function (MCAT Review)

## Overview
The brain and spinal cord form the central nervous system (CNS), which integrates sensory input, coordinates motor output, and supports cognition, emotion, and homeostasis. Their structure and function are foundational for MCAT success.

## 1. Brain Structure and Regions
- **Cerebrum:**
  - Largest part; divided into left/right hemispheres and four lobes
  - **Frontal Lobe:** Reasoning, planning, voluntary movement, speech, executive function, impulse control
  - **Parietal Lobe:** Sensory perception (touch, pain, temperature), spatial orientation, proprioception
  - **Temporal Lobe:** Auditory processing, memory formation, language comprehension (Wernicke's area)
  - **Occipital Lobe:** Visual processing (primary visual cortex)
  - **Corpus Callosum:** Connects hemispheres, enables interhemispheric communication
- **Cerebellum:**
  - Coordination, balance, fine motor control, motor learning, error correction
- **Brainstem:**
  - **Midbrain:** Visual/auditory reflexes, motor control, dopamine production (substantia nigra)
  - **Pons:** Relay between cerebrum and cerebellum, sleep, respiration, facial sensation/movement
  - **Medulla Oblongata:** Heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, vomiting, swallowing
- **Diencephalon:**
  - **Thalamus:** Sensory relay station (all senses except smell), consciousness, sleep
  - **Hypothalamus:** Homeostasis, endocrine control (pituitary gland), hunger/thirst, temperature, circadian rhythms, emotional response
  - **Pineal Gland:** Melatonin secretion, sleep-wake cycles
- **Basal Ganglia:**
  - Movement initiation, procedural learning, habit formation; affected in Parkinson's disease
- **Limbic System:**
  - Emotion, motivation, memory (hippocampus, amygdala)

## 2. Spinal Cord Structure and Function
- **Segments:** Cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, coccygeal
- **Gray Matter:** Cell bodies, interneurons (central "H" shape); dorsal (sensory) and ventral (motor) horns
- **White Matter:** Myelinated axons (ascending sensory and descending motor tracts)
- **Dorsal Root:** Sensory (afferent) input to CNS
- **Ventral Root:** Motor (efferent) output from CNS
- **Central Canal:** Contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
- **Reflex Arcs:** Simple, rapid responses (e.g., withdrawal reflex, patellar reflex); bypass brain for speed

---

## 3. CNS Functions
- **Integration:** Processes sensory input, coordinates motor output, decision-making
- **Higher Functions:** Cognition, emotion, memory, language, executive function
- **Autonomic Control:** Heart rate, respiration, digestion, blood pressure
- **Reflexes:** Fast, involuntary responses to stimuli; protective and homeostatic
- **Neuroplasticity:** Ability to reorganize and form new connections (learning, recovery from injury)

---

## 4. Protection and Support
- **Meninges:** Three layers (dura mater, arachnoid mater, pia mater) protect CNS
- **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF):** Cushions brain/spinal cord, removes waste, provides nutrients
- **Blood-Brain Barrier:** Selective permeability protects brain from toxins/pathogens

---

## 5. Clinical and MCAT Relevance
- **Stroke:** Loss of blood flow to brain regions; symptoms depend on affected area (e.g., hemiplegia, aphasia)
- **Spinal Cord Injury:** Loss of sensation/motor function below injury; level determines deficits
- **Parkinson's Disease:** Basal ganglia/substantia nigra dysfunction (motor control, tremor)
- **Multiple Sclerosis:** Demyelination in CNS; sensory/motor deficits
- **Brainstem Lesions:** Can affect vital functions (breathing, heart rate, consciousness)
- **Hydrocephalus:** Excess CSF; increased intracranial pressure

## Quiz

**Q1: Which brain region is primarily responsible for executive function and impulse control?**
A) Parietal lobe
B) Frontal lobe *[CORRECT]
C) Occipital lobe
D) Temporal lobe

**Q2: What is the main function of the basal ganglia?**
A) Sensory relay
B) Movement initiation and habit formation *[CORRECT]
C) Visual processing
D) Language comprehension
**Explanation:** Basal ganglia initiate movement and are involved in procedural learning.

**Q3: Which structure connects the two cerebral hemispheres?**
A) Thalamus
B) Corpus callosum *[CORRECT]
C) Hippocampus
D) Pons
**Explanation:** The corpus callosum enables communication between hemispheres.

**Q4: What is the role of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord?**
A) Motor output
B) Sensory input *[CORRECT]
C) CSF production
D) Reflex integration
**Explanation:** The dorsal horn receives sensory (afferent) signals from the body.

**Q5: Which part of the brain is most affected in Parkinson's disease?**
A) Cerebellum
B) Basal ganglia *[CORRECT]
C) Occipital lobe
D) Medulla oblongata
**Explanation:** Parkinson's disease involves degeneration of the basal ganglia/substantia nigra, affecting motor control.
