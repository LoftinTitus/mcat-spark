# Stress

## Overview
Stress is a physiological and psychological response to perceived challenges or threats (stressors). It plays a major role in health, disease, and behavior. On the MCAT, understanding the biology of stress, its psychological and social aspects, and its impact on health is essential for analyzing clinical vignettes and behavioral scenarios.

## Types of Stressors
- **Acute Stressors:** Short-term, immediate threats (e.g., exams, accidents).
- **Chronic Stressors:** Ongoing, persistent demands (e.g., financial problems, chronic illness).
- **Daily Hassles:** Minor, frequent irritations (e.g., traffic, arguments).
- **Traumatic Stressors:** Severe, life-threatening events (e.g., natural disasters, assault).

## Biological Response to Stress
- **General Adaptation Syndrome (Selye):**
  1. **Alarm Stage:** Activation of sympathetic nervous system, release of catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline).
  2. **Resistance Stage:** Adaptation to stressor, sustained cortisol release.
  3. **Exhaustion Stage:** Depletion of resources, increased vulnerability to illness.
- **HPA Axis:** Hypothalamus → pituitary → adrenal cortex → cortisol release.
- **Autonomic Nervous System:** Sympathetic (fight-or-flight) and parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) responses.

## Psychological and Social Aspects
- **Appraisal:** Cognitive evaluation of stressor (primary: is it a threat?; secondary: can I cope?).
- **Coping Strategies:**
  - **Problem-focused coping:** Addressing the source of stress.
  - **Emotion-focused coping:** Managing emotional response.
  - **Adaptive vs. maladaptive coping:** Healthy (exercise, seeking support) vs. unhealthy (substance use, avoidance).
- **Social Support:** Emotional, informational, and practical help from others; buffers stress effects.

## Effects of Stress on Health
- **Acute Stress:** Can enhance alertness and performance.
- **Chronic Stress:** Increases risk for cardiovascular disease, immune suppression, depression, anxiety, metabolic disorders.
- **Allostatic Load:** Cumulative wear and tear on the body from chronic stress.
- **Psychoneuroimmunology:** Study of how stress affects immune function.

## MCAT Connections
- **Application:** Recognize stress responses and coping in clinical vignettes.
- **Research:** Understand experimental design, measurement of stress, and health outcomes.
- **Critical Thinking:** Consider biopsychosocial model and individual differences in stress response.

## Quiz

**Q1: What hormone is primarily released by the adrenal cortex in response to stress?**
A) Adrenaline
B) Cortisol *[CORRECT]
C) Insulin
D) Dopamine
**Explanation:** Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid released during the stress response via the HPA axis.

**Q2: Which stage of the general adaptation syndrome involves adaptation and sustained resistance to the stressor?**
A) Alarm
B) Resistance *[CORRECT]
C) Exhaustion
D) Recovery
**Explanation:** The resistance stage is characterized by continued physiological adaptation to the stressor.

**Q3: What is allostatic load?**
A) The initial response to a stressor
B) The cumulative physiological burden from chronic stress *[CORRECT]
C) The process of coping with stress
D) The release of catecholamines
**Explanation:** Allostatic load refers to the long-term wear and tear on the body from repeated or chronic stress.

**Q4: Which coping strategy involves addressing the source of stress directly?**
A) Emotion-focused coping
B) Problem-focused coping *[CORRECT]
C) Avoidance
D) Maladaptive coping
**Explanation:** Problem-focused coping targets the cause of stress to reduce or eliminate it.

**Q5: What is the role of social support in stress?**
A) It increases allostatic load
B) It buffers the negative effects of stress *[CORRECT]
C) It triggers the alarm stage
D) It is a maladaptive coping strategy
**Explanation:** Social support helps individuals manage stress and reduces its harmful effects on health.
