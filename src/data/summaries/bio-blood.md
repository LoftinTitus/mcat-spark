# Blood: Components, Gas Exchange, and MCAT Relevance

## Overview
Blood is a specialized connective tissue that transports gases, nutrients, hormones, and waste, and plays key roles in immunity and homeostasis. Understanding its components and gas exchange is essential for the MCAT.

## 1. Components of Blood
- **Plasma:**
  - Liquid matrix (~55% of blood volume)
  - Water, electrolytes, proteins (albumin, globulins, fibrinogen), nutrients, hormones, waste
- **Formed Elements:**
  - **Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes):**
    - Biconcave, no nucleus; contain hemoglobin for O₂/CO₂ transport
    - Lifespan ~120 days; produced in bone marrow
  - **White Blood Cells (Leukocytes):**
    - Immune defense; several types (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils)
  - **Platelets (Thrombocytes):**
    - Cell fragments; essential for clotting

## 2. Gas Transport and Exchange
- **Oxygen Transport:**
  - Carried by hemoglobin in RBCs; binds O₂ in lungs, releases in tissues
  - Oxyhemoglobin (O₂ bound), deoxyhemoglobin (O₂ released)
  - Affinity affected by pH, CO₂, temperature, 2,3-BPG (Bohr effect)
- **Carbon Dioxide Transport:**
  - Dissolved in plasma (~7%)
  - Bound to hemoglobin (~23%)
  - As bicarbonate ion (HCO₃⁻, ~70%) via carbonic anhydrase
- **Gas Exchange Sites:**
  - **Lungs (Alveoli):** O₂ enters blood, CO₂ leaves
  - **Tissues:** O₂ leaves blood, CO₂ enters

## 3. Hemostasis and Clotting
- **Platelet Plug Formation:** Platelets adhere to injury site, form plug
- **Coagulation Cascade:** Series of enzymatic steps; fibrin forms stable clot
- **Fibrinolysis:** Breakdown of clot after healing

---

## 4. Blood Groups and Immunity
- **ABO System:** A, B, AB, O types; based on antigens on RBCs
- **Rh Factor:** Positive/negative; important in transfusions and pregnancy
- **Immune Function:** WBCs defend against pathogens; antibodies in plasma

---

## 5. Clinical and MCAT Relevance
- **Anemia:** Low RBCs/hemoglobin; fatigue, pallor
- **Polycythemia:** Excess RBCs; increased viscosity, risk of clots
- **Leukemia:** Cancer of WBCs; immune dysfunction
- **Hemophilia:** Clotting factor deficiency; bleeding risk
- **Sickle Cell Disease:** Abnormal hemoglobin; RBCs sickle, block vessels
- **Transfusion Reactions:** Incompatible blood types; immune response

## Quiz

**Q1: What is the main function of hemoglobin?**
A) Immune defense
B) Blood clotting
C) Oxygen transport *[CORRECT]
D) Hormone production
**Explanation:** Hemoglobin binds and transports oxygen in red blood cells.

**Q2: Which blood component is responsible for clot formation?**
A) Plasma
B) Platelets *[CORRECT]
C) White blood cells
D) Hemoglobin
**Explanation:** Platelets initiate clotting by forming a plug and activating the coagulation cascade.

**Q3: How is most carbon dioxide transported in the blood?**
A) Dissolved in plasma
B) Bound to hemoglobin
C) As bicarbonate ion *[CORRECT]
D) As carbonic acid
**Explanation:** Most CO₂ is converted to bicarbonate ion in plasma.

**Q4: What is the Bohr effect?**
A) Increased hemoglobin affinity for O₂ at low pH
B) Decreased hemoglobin affinity for O₂ at low pH *[CORRECT]
C) Increased platelet activation
D) Increased WBC production
**Explanation:** The Bohr effect describes how low pH (high CO₂) decreases hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen.

**Q5: Which blood type is the universal donor?**
A) AB+
B) O- *[CORRECT]
C) A+
D) B-
**Explanation:** O- blood lacks A, B, and Rh antigens, making it the universal donor.
