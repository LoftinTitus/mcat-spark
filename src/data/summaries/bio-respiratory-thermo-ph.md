## Thermoregulation and pH Regulation in the Respiratory System (MCAT Focus)

### Thermoregulation via the Respiratory System
The respiratory system contributes to body temperature regulation through heat exchange and evaporative cooling:
- **Heat loss during breathing:** Air is warmed and humidified in the upper respiratory tract; exhaled air carries heat and water vapor out of the body.
- **Evaporative cooling:** Increased respiratory rate (panting) in some animals enhances heat loss via evaporation.
- **Clinical relevance:** Hyperventilation can increase heat loss; hypothermia risk in cold environments due to respiratory heat loss.

### pH Regulation: Acid-Base Homeostasis
The respiratory system is a key regulator of blood pH through control of CO₂ exhalation:
- **CO₂ as an acid:** CO₂ combines with H₂O to form carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), which dissociates into H⁺ and HCO₃⁻ (bicarbonate).
- **Carbonic anhydrase:** Enzyme in red blood cells and alveolar cells catalyzes this reaction.
- **Respiratory compensation:**
  - **Hyperventilation:** ↑ breathing rate → ↓ CO₂ → ↓ H⁺ → ↑ pH (respiratory alkalosis)
  - **Hypoventilation:** ↓ breathing rate → ↑ CO₂ → ↑ H⁺ → ↓ pH (respiratory acidosis)
- **Buffer systems:** Bicarbonate buffer is the primary extracellular buffer; respiratory system works with kidneys for long-term pH balance.

### Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation Curve and pH
- **Bohr effect:** Decreased pH (increased H⁺) and increased CO₂ shift the curve right, promoting O₂ release to tissues.
- **Respiratory alkalosis/acidosis:** Alters hemoglobin affinity for O₂, impacting tissue oxygenation.

### MCAT Clinical Relevance
- **Respiratory acidosis:** Seen in COPD, drug overdose, airway obstruction; symptoms include confusion, lethargy.
- **Respiratory alkalosis:** Seen in anxiety, pain, high altitude; symptoms include dizziness, tingling.
- **Metabolic compensation:** Kidneys adjust H⁺ and HCO₃⁻ excretion to compensate for respiratory pH changes.
- **Thermoregulatory disorders:** Fever, heat stroke, hypothermia can be influenced by respiratory heat loss.

## Quiz

**Q1: How does hyperventilation affect blood pH?**
A) Decreases pH (acidosis)
B) Increases pH (alkalosis) *[CORRECT]
C) No effect
D) Causes metabolic acidosis
**Explanation:** Hyperventilation lowers CO₂, raising blood pH (respiratory alkalosis).

**Q2: What enzyme catalyzes the conversion of CO₂ and H₂O to carbonic acid in red blood cells?**
A) Hemoglobin
B) Carbonic anhydrase *[CORRECT]
C) Amylase
D) ATP synthase
**Explanation:** Carbonic anhydrase rapidly converts CO₂ and H₂O to carbonic acid, facilitating pH regulation.

**Q3: What is the main buffer system in the blood regulated by the respiratory system?**
A) Phosphate buffer
B) Bicarbonate buffer *[CORRECT]
C) Protein buffer
D) Ammonia buffer
**Explanation:** The bicarbonate buffer system is the primary extracellular buffer for pH regulation.

**Q4: How does increased CO₂ in the blood affect the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve?**
A) Shifts left (increased affinity)
B) Shifts right (decreased affinity) *[CORRECT]
C) No change
D) Increases O₂ binding
**Explanation:** Increased CO₂ and H⁺ shift the curve right (Bohr effect), promoting O₂ release to tissues.

**Q5: Which respiratory change is most likely to occur during fever or heat stroke?**
A) Decreased respiratory rate
B) Increased respiratory rate (hyperventilation) *[CORRECT]
C) No change
D) Apnea
**Explanation:** Increased respiratory rate enhances heat loss and helps regulate body temperature during fever/heat stroke.
