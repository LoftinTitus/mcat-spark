## Layers of the Skin: Structure, Function, and MCAT Relevance

### Overview
The skin is the largest organ of the body, serving as a barrier, sensory organ, and regulator of temperature and water loss. It consists of three main layers, each with distinct structures and functions relevant to physiology and pathology.

### Epidermis
- **Outermost layer; avascular; stratified squamous epithelium**
- **Layers (from superficial to deep):**
  - **Stratum corneum:** Dead, keratinized cells; barrier to pathogens and water loss
  - **Stratum lucidum:** Clear layer; present only in thick skin (palms, soles)
  - **Stratum granulosum:** Keratin granules; waterproofing
  - **Stratum spinosum:** Desmosomes; strength and flexibility
  - **Stratum basale (germinativum):** Stem cells; mitosis; melanocytes (pigment production)
- **Functions:** Protection, water resistance, UV protection (melanin), regeneration

### Dermis
- **Middle layer; connective tissue; vascularized**
- **Components:**
  - **Papillary layer:** Loose connective tissue; capillaries; Meissner's corpuscles (touch)
  - **Reticular layer:** Dense irregular connective tissue; collagen/elastic fibers; strength and elasticity
  - **Structures:** Hair follicles, sweat glands (eccrine/apocrine), sebaceous glands, nerve endings, blood vessels
- **Functions:** Sensation, thermoregulation, support, immune defense

### Hypodermis (Subcutaneous Layer)
- **Deepest layer; not technically part of skin; loose connective tissue and adipose (fat)**
- **Functions:** Insulation, energy storage, shock absorption, anchors skin to underlying tissues

### MCAT Clinical Relevance
- **Burns:** Classified by depth (superficial, partial, full thickness); affects layers and healing
- **Skin cancer:** Basal cell carcinoma (stratum basale), squamous cell carcinoma (stratum spinosum), melanoma (melanocytes)
- **Vitiligo/albinism:** Disorders of melanocytes/pigment
- **Psoriasis:** Hyperproliferation of epidermis
- **Decubitus ulcers:** Damage to dermis/hypodermis from pressure

## Quiz

**Q1: Which layer of the epidermis contains stem cells responsible for regeneration?**
A) Stratum corneum
B) Stratum basale *[CORRECT]
C) Stratum granulosum
D) Stratum spinosum
**Explanation:** The stratum basale contains stem cells that divide to replenish the epidermis.

**Q2: What is the main function of the hypodermis?**
A) Sensation
B) Insulation and energy storage *[CORRECT]
C) Waterproofing
D) Pigment production
**Explanation:** The hypodermis is rich in adipose tissue, providing insulation and energy storage.

**Q3: Which structure in the dermis is responsible for touch sensation?**
A) Melanocyte
B) Meissner's corpuscle *[CORRECT]
C) Sebaceous gland
D) Arrector pili muscle
**Explanation:** Meissner's corpuscles in the papillary dermis detect light touch.

**Q4: Which layer of the epidermis is only found in thick skin?**
A) Stratum corneum
B) Stratum lucidum *[CORRECT]
C) Stratum granulosum
D) Stratum spinosum
**Explanation:** The stratum lucidum is present only in thick skin (palms, soles).

**Q5: Which cell type produces melanin for UV protection?**
A) Keratinocyte
B) Melanocyte *[CORRECT]
C) Fibroblast
D) Langerhans cell
**Explanation:** Melanocytes in the stratum basale produce melanin, protecting against UV damage.
