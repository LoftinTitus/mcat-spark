# Smooth Muscle: MCAT Review

Smooth muscle is an involuntary, non-striated muscle tissue found in the walls of hollow organs and blood vessels. It plays a key role in regulating organ function, blood flow, and movement of substances. MCAT questions often focus on its structure, contraction mechanism, regulation, and clinical relevance.

## Structure
- **Cells:** Spindle-shaped, single central nucleus, no striations (no sarcomeres).
- **Location:** Found in walls of blood vessels, GI tract, respiratory tract, urinary bladder, uterus, and more.
- **Arrangement:** Cells are arranged in sheets or layers; can contract as a unit (single-unit) or independently (multi-unit).

## Contraction Mechanism
- **Actin and Myosin:** Present, but not organized into sarcomeres; contraction is slower and sustained.
- **Calcium Regulation:** Calcium enters cell from extracellular space and binds to calmodulin (not troponin).
- **Myosin Light Chain Kinase (MLCK):** Activated by Ca2+-calmodulin, phosphorylates myosin, enabling cross-bridge cycling.
- **Single-Unit vs. Multi-Unit:**
  - **Single-Unit:** Cells connected by gap junctions; contract together (e.g., GI tract, uterus).
  - **Multi-Unit:** Cells contract independently (e.g., iris, large arteries).

## Regulation
- **Autonomic Nervous System:**
  - **Sympathetic:** Can cause contraction or relaxation depending on receptor type (e.g., vasoconstriction via alpha-adrenergic receptors).
  - **Parasympathetic:** Often stimulates contraction (e.g., GI motility).
- **Hormonal Control:** Oxytocin (uterine contraction), epinephrine (bronchodilation), etc.
- **Local Factors:** pH, oxygen, CO2, nitric oxide can modulate contraction.

## Functions
- **Vasoconstriction/Vasodilation:** Regulates blood pressure and flow.
- **Peristalsis:** Moves food through GI tract.
- **Bronchoconstriction/Bronchodilation:** Regulates airway diameter.
- **Bladder/Uterine Contraction:** Controls urination and childbirth.

## Clinical Relevance
- **Asthma:** Excessive bronchoconstriction due to smooth muscle hyperactivity.
- **Hypertension:** Increased vascular smooth muscle tone.
- **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):** Abnormal GI smooth muscle contraction.
- **Preterm Labor:** Excess uterine smooth muscle contraction.

## Quiz

**Q1: Which protein does calcium bind to in smooth muscle to initiate contraction?**
A) Troponin
B) Calmodulin *[CORRECT]
C) Myosin
D) Actin
**Explanation:** Calcium binds to calmodulin, activating MLCK and enabling contraction.

**Q2: What is the main difference between single-unit and multi-unit smooth muscle?**
A) Presence of sarcomeres
B) Number of nuclei per cell
C) Degree of electrical coupling via gap junctions *[CORRECT]
D) Location in the body
**Explanation:** Single-unit smooth muscle cells are electrically coupled by gap junctions and contract together; multi-unit cells contract independently.

**Q3: Which nervous system division most often stimulates GI tract smooth muscle contraction?**
A) Sympathetic
B) Parasympathetic *[CORRECT]
C) Somatic
D) Central
**Explanation:** Parasympathetic stimulation increases GI motility via smooth muscle contraction.

**Q4: Which enzyme is activated by Ca2+-calmodulin to phosphorylate myosin in smooth muscle?**
A) Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) *[CORRECT]
B) Adenylate cyclase
C) Protein kinase A
D) Phospholipase C
**Explanation:** MLCK phosphorylates myosin, enabling cross-bridge formation and contraction.

**Q5: Excessive contraction of airway smooth muscle leads to which condition?**
A) Hypertension
B) Asthma *[CORRECT]
C) IBS
D) Preterm labor
**Explanation:** Asthma is characterized by bronchoconstriction due to smooth muscle hyperactivity in the airways.
