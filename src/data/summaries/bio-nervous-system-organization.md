# Organization of the Nervous System

## Overview
The nervous system is a complex network that coordinates body functions and responses to internal and external stimuli. Its organization is foundational for understanding neurobiology and is highly relevant for the MCAT.

## 1. Major Divisions
- **Central Nervous System (CNS):**
  - Brain and spinal cord
  - Integrates and processes information; site of higher functions (thought, memory)
- **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):**
  - All neural tissue outside the CNS
  - Connects CNS to limbs and organs

---

## 2. Peripheral Nervous System Subdivisions
- **Somatic Nervous System (SNS):**
  - Voluntary control of skeletal muscles
  - Sensory (afferent) and motor (efferent) pathways
- **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS):**
  - Involuntary control of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, glands
  - Further divided into:
    - **Sympathetic Nervous System:** "Fight or flight" (increases heart rate, dilates pupils, inhibits digestion)
    - **Parasympathetic Nervous System:** "Rest and digest" (slows heart rate, stimulates digestion, constricts pupils)
    - **Enteric Nervous System:** Regulates GI tract independently but modulated by ANS

---

## 3. Functional Organization
- **Sensory (Afferent) Division:**
  - Transmits sensory information from receptors to CNS
- **Motor (Efferent) Division:**
  - Transmits commands from CNS to effectors (muscles, glands)
- **Reflex Arcs:**
  - Simple neural circuits for rapid, automatic responses (e.g., withdrawal reflex)

---

## 4. Brain Regions and Functions (CNS)
- **Cerebrum:** Higher cognitive functions, voluntary movement, sensory perception
- **Cerebellum:** Coordination, balance
- **Brainstem:** Basic life functions (breathing, heart rate)
- **Spinal Cord:** Conduit for signals between brain and body; site of reflexes

---

## 5. Clinical and MCAT Relevance
- **Autonomic Disorders:** Dysautonomia, orthostatic hypotension
- **Spinal Cord Injury:** Loss of sensation/motor function below injury
- **Neurotransmitter Pathways:** Dopaminergic, cholinergic, adrenergic systems
- **Pharmacology:** Drugs target specific divisions (e.g., beta-blockers, anticholinergics)

## Quiz

**Q1: Which division of the nervous system controls voluntary movement?**
A) Autonomic nervous system
B) Somatic nervous system *[CORRECT]
C) Sympathetic nervous system
D) Enteric nervous system
**Explanation:** The somatic nervous system controls voluntary movements of skeletal muscles.

**Q2: What is the main function of the sympathetic nervous system?**
A) Rest and digest
B) Fight or flight *[CORRECT]
C) Sensory integration
D) Coordination
**Explanation:** The sympathetic nervous system prepares the body for emergencies (fight or flight).

**Q3: Which part of the CNS is responsible for basic life functions like breathing and heart rate?**
A) Cerebrum
B) Cerebellum
C) Brainstem *[CORRECT]
D) Spinal cord
**Explanation:** The brainstem controls vital autonomic functions.

**Q4: What does the enteric nervous system regulate?**
A) Heart rate
B) GI tract *[CORRECT]
C) Voluntary movement
D) Breathing
**Explanation:** The enteric nervous system controls gastrointestinal function.

**Q5: Which pathway transmits sensory information to the CNS?**
A) Motor (efferent)
B) Sensory (afferent) *[CORRECT]
C) Parasympathetic
D) Sympathetic
**Explanation:** Sensory (afferent) neurons carry information from receptors to the CNS.
