# Meiosis

## Overview
Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that produces gametes (sperm and eggs) with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell. It is essential for sexual reproduction and genetic diversity. Meiosis consists of two sequential divisions: Meiosis I and Meiosis II.

---

## 1. Key Purposes of Meiosis
- Reduces chromosome number by half (diploid → haploid)
- Generates genetic diversity through recombination and independent assortment
- Produces four genetically unique gametes from one parent cell

---

## 2. Phases of Meiosis
### Meiosis I (Reductional Division)
- **Prophase I:** Homologous chromosomes pair (synapsis) and exchange genetic material (crossing over at chiasmata)
- **Metaphase I:** Homologous pairs align at the metaphase plate
- **Anaphase I:** Homologous chromosomes separate (sister chromatids remain together)
- **Telophase I & Cytokinesis:** Two haploid cells form, each with duplicated chromosomes

### Meiosis II (Equational Division)
- **Prophase II:** Chromosomes condense in each haploid cell
- **Metaphase II:** Chromosomes align at the metaphase plate
- **Anaphase II:** Sister chromatids finally separate
- **Telophase II & Cytokinesis:** Four haploid gametes result, each genetically distinct

---

## 3. Sources of Genetic Variation
- **Crossing Over:** Exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during Prophase I
- **Independent Assortment:** Random orientation of homologous pairs during Metaphase I
- **Random Fertilization:** Any sperm can fertilize any egg

---

## 4. Meiosis vs. Mitosis
- **Mitosis:** One division, produces two identical diploid cells, for growth/repair
- **Meiosis:** Two divisions, produces four unique haploid gametes, for reproduction
- **Key Differences:** Synapsis and crossing over only in meiosis; chromosome number halved in meiosis

---

## 5. Clinical Relevance
- **Nondisjunction:** Failure of chromosomes to separate properly (can occur in Meiosis I or II), leading to aneuploidy (e.g., Down syndrome, Turner syndrome)
- **Genetic Disorders:** Many arise from errors in meiosis

## Quiz

**Q1: What is the main purpose of Meiosis I?**
A) To separate sister chromatids
B) To reduce chromosome number by half *[CORRECT]
C) To replicate DNA
D) To produce identical cells
**Explanation:** Meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes, reducing the chromosome number from diploid to haploid.

**Q2: During which phase does crossing over occur?**
A) Metaphase I
B) Prophase I *[CORRECT]
C) Anaphase II
D) Telophase II
**Explanation:** Crossing over occurs during Prophase I when homologous chromosomes pair up.

**Q3: How many genetically unique gametes are produced from one diploid cell after meiosis?**
A) 2
B) 4 *[CORRECT]
C) 8
D) 1
**Explanation:** Meiosis produces four genetically distinct haploid gametes from one parent cell.

**Q4: What is a key difference between meiosis and mitosis?**
A) Meiosis produces diploid cells
B) Crossing over occurs in mitosis
C) Meiosis involves two cell divisions *[CORRECT]
D) Mitosis produces gametes
**Explanation:** Meiosis has two divisions (I and II), while mitosis has only one.

**Q5: What is nondisjunction?**
A) Normal separation of chromosomes
B) Failure of chromosomes to replicate
C) Failure of chromosomes to separate properly *[CORRECT]
D) Crossing over between non-homologous chromosomes
**Explanation:** Nondisjunction is the failure of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids to separate, leading to abnormal chromosome numbers.
