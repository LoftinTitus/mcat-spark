# Viruses

## Overview
Viruses are acellular infectious agents that require host cells to replicate. They play major roles in disease, evolution, and biotechnology. Understanding their structure, life cycles, and interactions with hosts is essential for the MCAT.

## 1. Structure of Viruses
- **Genome:** DNA or RNA (not both), single- or double-stranded, linear or circular, segmented or non-segmented
- **Capsid:** Protein shell (helical, icosahedral, or complex)
- **Envelope:** Lipid membrane derived from host (enveloped viruses); non-enveloped (naked viruses) lack this
- **Surface proteins:** Mediate host cell recognition and entry (e.g., hemagglutinin in influenza, gp120 in HIV)

---

## 2. Viral Life Cycles
- **Attachment:** Virus binds specific host cell receptors
- **Entry:** Endocytosis, membrane fusion, or direct injection
- **Uncoating:** Release of viral genome into host cell
- **Replication:**
  - **DNA viruses:** Usually replicate in nucleus using host machinery
  - **RNA viruses:** Usually replicate in cytoplasm; require RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
  - **Retroviruses:** Use reverse transcriptase to make DNA from RNA (e.g., HIV)
- **Assembly:** New viral particles assembled from genome and proteins
- **Release:** Budding (enveloped) or cell lysis (naked)

## 3. Viral Genomes & Classification
- **DNA viruses:** e.g., Herpesviruses, Adenoviruses, Poxviruses
- **RNA viruses:** e.g., Influenza, Coronavirus, Poliovirus
- **Retroviruses:** e.g., HIV
- **Positive-sense RNA:** Genome can be directly translated
- **Negative-sense RNA:** Must be transcribed to positive-sense before translation

---

## 4. Bacteriophages (Phages)
- **Lytic cycle:** Phage replicates, lyses host cell (e.g., T4 phage)
- **Lysogenic cycle:** Phage genome integrates into host DNA (prophage), can reactivate to lytic
- **Transduction:** Phages transfer bacterial genes between cells (horizontal gene transfer)

---

## 5. Host Interactions & Immune Evasion
- **Host range:** Determined by surface proteins and receptors
- **Antigenic drift:** Small mutations in viral genes (e.g., influenza)
- **Antigenic shift:** Reassortment of genome segments (major changes, pandemics)
- **Latency:** Some viruses remain dormant (e.g., herpesviruses)
- **Immune evasion:** Rapid mutation, inhibition of antigen presentation, latency

---

## 6. Clinical Relevance & Applications
- **Vaccines:** Inactivated, live-attenuated, subunit, mRNA
- **Antivirals:** Target viral enzymes (e.g., reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors)
- **Oncogenic viruses:** HPV (cervical cancer), EBV (Burkitt lymphoma), HBV/HCV (liver cancer)
- **Gene therapy:** Modified viruses deliver therapeutic genes

## Quiz

**Q1: What is the genetic material of all viruses?**
A) DNA only
B) RNA only
C) DNA or RNA, but never both *[CORRECT]
D) Both DNA and RNA in the same virion
**Explanation:** Viruses have either DNA or RNA genomes, never both in the same particle.

**Q2: Which enzyme is required for replication of retroviruses?**
A) DNA polymerase
B) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
C) Reverse transcriptase *[CORRECT]
D) Ligase
**Explanation:** Reverse transcriptase synthesizes DNA from an RNA template in retroviruses.

**Q3: What is the main difference between the lytic and lysogenic cycles of bacteriophages?**
A) Only lytic cycle involves integration into host genome
B) Lysogenic cycle involves integration and can become lytic *[CORRECT]
C) Lytic cycle is always dormant
D) Lysogenic cycle always kills the host cell immediately
**Explanation:** Lysogenic phages integrate into the host genome and can later enter the lytic cycle.

**Q4: Which of the following best describes antigenic shift?**
A) Small point mutations in viral genes
B) Reassortment of genome segments causing major changes *[CORRECT]
C) Integration of viral DNA into host genome
D) Latency in host cells
**Explanation:** Antigenic shift is a major change due to reassortment, often leading to pandemics.

**Q5: Which virus is associated with cancer development?**
A) Influenza
B) Human papillomavirus (HPV) *[CORRECT]
C) Rhinovirus
D) Rabies
**Explanation:** HPV is an oncogenic virus linked to cervical and other cancers.
