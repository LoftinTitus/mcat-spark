# Amino Acids & Protein Structure: Classification, Properties, and Folding

## Overview
This lesson covers the chemical structure of amino acids, how they're classified, how peptide bonds form, and the levels of protein structure (primary → quaternary). It also explains the physical forces that drive folding, common structural motifs (α-helix, β-sheet), folding pathways, chaperones, and clinically relevant concepts like denaturation and post-translational modifications.

## 1. Amino Acid Basic Structure
- General backbone: NH3+–CH(R)–C(=O)O− (at physiological pH). The central carbon is the alpha carbon (Cα).
- Functional groups:
  - Amino group (—NH3+ at physiological pH)
  - Carboxyl group (—COO− at physiological pH)
  - Side chain (R group) — determines chemical properties
- All proteinogenic amino acids (except glycine) are chiral at Cα and exist in the L-configuration in proteins.

### Key atomic features
- Peptide bond: amide linkage formed between the carboxyl of one amino acid and amino of the next (—CO—NH—). It has partial double-bond character (planar, restricted rotation).

## 2. Amino Acid Classification (Useful groupings)
- Nonpolar (hydrophobic): Gly (G), Ala (A), Val (V), Leu (L), Ile (I), Met (M), Pro (P)
- Aromatic: Phe (F), Tyr (Y), Trp (W)
- Polar, uncharged: Ser (S), Thr (T), Asn (N), Gln (Q), Cys (C)
- Positively charged (basic): Lys (K), Arg (R), His (H)
- Negatively charged (acidic): Asp (D), Glu (E)

Special notes:
- Glycine (G) is small and flexible (no side-chain stereochemistry).
- Proline (P) is a helix breaker because its side chain covalently binds the backbone N— it restricts φ angle.
- Cysteine (C) can form disulfide bonds (—S—S—) when oxidized, important for extracellular proteins.
- Histidine (H) has a pKa ≈ 6–6.5, allowing it to act as a proton shuttle at physiological pH.

---

## 3. Ionizable Groups and pKa / pI
- Amino acids with ionizable side chains: D, E, H, C, Y, K, R, plus N-terminus and C-terminus.
- Henderson–Hasselbalch for side chain: pH = pKa + log([A−]/[HA])
- Isoelectric point (pI): pH where net charge = 0. For simple amino acids without ionizable side chain: average of pKa(NH3+) and pKa(COOH). For acidic/basic side chains, pI depends on relevant pKa values.

Practical MCAT tips:
- At pH below pKa → group is protonated; above pKa → deprotonated.
- Lys/Arg are positively charged at physiological pH; Asp/Glu are negatively charged.

---

## 4. Peptide Bond and Primary Structure
- Primary structure = sequence of amino acids (N-terminus → C-terminus).
- Peptide bond formation is a condensation reaction (releases water) catalyzed by the ribosome during translation.
- Because the peptide bond has partial double-bond character, the backbone is planar; rotation primarily occurs about the N–Cα (φ) and Cα–C (ψ) bonds.

Ramachandran plot:
- Displays allowed φ and ψ angles; steric hindrance restricts conformations. α-helices and β-sheets occupy distinct regions.

---

## 5. Secondary Structure
- Local hydrogen-bonded backbone conformations.

Main motifs:
- α-helix
  - Right-handed most commonly
  - ~3.6 residues per turn; hydrogen bonds between C=O(i) and N–H(i+4)
  - Side chains point outward
  - Proline disrupts helix
- β-sheet
  - Strands aligned side-by-side, hydrogen bonds between strands
  - Parallel (strands same N→C direction) vs antiparallel (opposite directions)
  - R groups alternate above and below the sheet plane
- Turns and loops
  - β-turns often contain Pro or Gly; connect strands and helices; flexible

---

## 6. Tertiary Structure
- Tertiary = 3D arrangement of a single polypeptide chain.
- Stabilized by:
  - Hydrophobic interactions: nonpolar side chains cluster inside (hydrophobic core)
  - Hydrogen bonds: side chain–side chain and side chain–backbone
  - Ionic (electrostatic) interactions / salt bridges between charged residues
  - Disulfide bonds (covalent) between cysteines — common in secreted/extracellular proteins
  - van der Waals interactions

Hydrophobic effect is the dominant driving force for folding in aqueous environments: bury nonpolar residues to minimize ordered water cage formation and increase entropy of solvent.

---

## 7. Quaternary Structure
- Assembly of multiple polypeptide subunits (e.g., hemoglobin = α2β2).
- Stabilized by the same forces as tertiary structure (noncovalent and sometimes covalent bonds).
- Important for cooperativity and allosteric regulation.

---

## 8. Protein Folding Pathways & Kinetics
- Folding is often hierarchical: local secondary structures form quickly, followed by collapse into tertiary structure.
- Folding funnel model: many unfolded conformations funnel toward a native state (lowest free energy).
- Misfolding can lead to aggregation and diseases (e.g., amyloid in Alzheimer's, prion diseases).

Kinetic concepts:
- Native state is thermodynamically favored under physiological conditions, but folding can involve kinetic traps.
- Molecular chaperones (e.g., Hsp70, GroEL/GroES) assist folding and prevent aggregation.

---

## 9. Denaturation & Stability
- Denaturation: loss of secondary/tertiary/quaternary structure (primary sequence remains intact).
- Denaturants: heat, extreme pH, urea, guanidinium chloride, detergents (SDS), DTT (reduces disulfide bonds).
- Renaturation: some proteins can refold spontaneously if denaturant removed; others need chaperones.

---

## 10. Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs)
- Common PTMs that affect structure/function:
  - Phosphorylation (Ser/Thr/Tyr) — regulatory, adds negative charge
  - Glycosylation (Asn, Ser/Thr) — affects folding, stability, localization
  - Acetylation (Lys) — gene regulation when on histones
  - Ubiquitination (Lys) — targets proteins for degradation
  - Disulfide bond formation — stabilizes extracellular proteins

## Quiz

**Q1: Which amino acid is considered a 'helix breaker' due to its rigid cyclic structure that restricts backbone rotation?**
A) Glycine (G)
B) Proline (P) *[CORRECT]
C) Cysteine (C)
D) Histidine (H)
**Explanation:** Proline is a helix breaker because its side chain forms a ring with the backbone nitrogen, restricting the φ (phi) angle and preventing the regular hydrogen bonding pattern needed for α-helix formation.

**Q2: At physiological pH (~7.4), which amino acids would be positively charged?**
A) Aspartate and Glutamate
B) Serine and Threonine
C) Lysine and Arginine *[CORRECT]
D) Tyrosine and Cysteine
**Explanation:** Lysine (K) and Arginine (R) are basic amino acids with pKa values above 7.4, so they remain protonated (positively charged) at physiological pH. Histidine can also be positively charged but its pKa (~6) makes it partially protonated.

**Q3: What is the primary driving force for protein folding in aqueous environments?**
A) Formation of disulfide bonds
B) Ionic interactions between charged residues
C) Hydrophobic effect (burial of nonpolar residues) *[CORRECT]
D) Hydrogen bonding between backbone atoms
**Explanation:** The hydrophobic effect is the dominant driving force. Nonpolar amino acids cluster in the protein core to minimize unfavorable interactions with water, increasing the entropy of the surrounding solvent by reducing ordered water cages.

**Q4: In an α-helix, the backbone carbonyl oxygen of residue i forms a hydrogen bond with which group?**
A) The backbone N-H of residue i+3
B) The backbone N-H of residue i+4 *[CORRECT]
C) The side chain of residue i+1
D) The backbone carbonyl of residue i+2
**Explanation:** In an α-helix, hydrogen bonds form between the C=O of residue i and the N-H of residue i+4, creating a regular helical structure with approximately 3.6 residues per turn.

**Q5: Where would you most likely find disulfide bonds in proteins, and why?**
A) In the cytoplasm, because of the oxidizing environment
B) In extracellular proteins, because of the oxidizing environment *[CORRECT]
C) In mitochondrial matrix proteins, due to high ATP concentrations
D) Equally distributed in all cellular compartments
**Explanation:** Disulfide bonds (Cys-Cys) are most common in extracellular and secreted proteins because the extracellular space is oxidizing. The cytoplasm is reducing (due to glutathione), which keeps cysteines in the reduced -SH form and prevents disulfide bond formation.
