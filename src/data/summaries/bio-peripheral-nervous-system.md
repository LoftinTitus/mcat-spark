# Peripheral Nervous System (PNS): Structure and Function (MCAT Review)

## Overview
The peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the central nervous system (CNS) to the rest of the body, enabling sensation, movement, and regulation of internal organs. Its organization and function are essential for MCAT neurobiology.

## 1. Structure of the PNS
- **Components:**
  - All neural tissue outside the brain and spinal cord
  - Includes cranial nerves (12 pairs) and spinal nerves (31 pairs)
- **Ganglia:**
  - Clusters of neuron cell bodies outside the CNS (sensory and autonomic ganglia)
- **Nerves:**
  - Bundles of axons (sensory, motor, or mixed)

---

## 2. Functional Divisions
- **Somatic Nervous System (SNS):**
  - Voluntary control of skeletal muscles
  - Sensory (afferent) neurons: transmit information from skin, muscles, joints to CNS
  - Motor (efferent) neurons: carry commands from CNS to skeletal muscles
- **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS):**
  - Involuntary control of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, glands
  - Subdivided into:
    - **Sympathetic Nervous System:** "Fight or flight" (increases heart rate, dilates pupils, inhibits digestion)
    - **Parasympathetic Nervous System:** "Rest and digest" (slows heart rate, stimulates digestion, constricts pupils)
    - **Enteric Nervous System:** Regulates GI tract independently but modulated by ANS

---

## 3. Cranial and Spinal Nerves
- **Cranial Nerves:**
  - Originate from the brain; control head/neck sensation and movement, some autonomic functions
  - Examples: Optic nerve (vision), Vagus nerve (parasympathetic control of heart, GI)
- **Spinal Nerves:**
  - Originate from spinal cord; control sensation and movement in limbs and trunk
  - Each has dorsal (sensory) and ventral (motor) roots

---

## 4. Clinical and MCAT Relevance
- **Peripheral Neuropathy:** Damage to PNS nerves; causes weakness, numbness, pain
- **Guillain-Barré Syndrome:** Autoimmune attack on PNS myelin; rapid-onset muscle weakness
- **Autonomic Dysfunction:** Orthostatic hypotension, abnormal sweating, digestive issues
- **Nerve Injury:** Loss of sensation/motor function in affected region
- **Pharmacology:** Drugs target specific PNS divisions (e.g., anticholinergics, beta-blockers)

## Quiz

**Q1: Which division of the PNS controls voluntary movement of skeletal muscles?**
A) Autonomic nervous system
B) Somatic nervous system *[CORRECT]
C) Sympathetic nervous system
D) Enteric nervous system
**Explanation:** The somatic nervous system controls voluntary movements.

**Q2: What is the main function of the vagus nerve?**
A) Vision
B) Hearing
C) Parasympathetic control of heart and GI tract *[CORRECT]
D) Motor control of limbs
**Explanation:** The vagus nerve provides parasympathetic innervation to thoracic and abdominal organs.

**Q3: Which part of the PNS is responsible for "fight or flight" responses?**
A) Parasympathetic nervous system
B) Sympathetic nervous system *[CORRECT]
C) Somatic nervous system
D) Enteric nervous system
**Explanation:** The sympathetic nervous system prepares the body for emergencies.

**Q4: What are ganglia in the PNS?**
A) Bundles of axons
B) Clusters of neuron cell bodies *[CORRECT]
C) Myelinated tracts
D) Sensory receptors
**Explanation:** Ganglia are clusters of neuron cell bodies outside the CNS.

**Q5: Which disorder involves autoimmune attack on PNS myelin?**
A) Multiple sclerosis
B) Guillain-Barré syndrome *[CORRECT]
C) Parkinson's disease
D) Stroke
**Explanation:** Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute demyelinating disorder of the PNS.
