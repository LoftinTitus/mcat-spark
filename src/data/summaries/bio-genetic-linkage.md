# Genetic Linkage

## Overview
Genetic linkage refers to the tendency of genes located close together on the same chromosome to be inherited together during meiosis. Linkage affects the assortment of traits and is a key concept in classical and molecular genetics, with direct MCAT relevance.

## 1. Chromosomes and Gene Location
- Genes are arranged linearly on chromosomes.
- Genes that are physically close are said to be "linked."
- Linked genes do not assort independently (violating Mendel's law of independent assortment).

---

## 2. Linkage and Recombination
- **Crossing Over:** During Prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes exchange segments.
- The closer two genes are, the less likely a crossover will occur between them.
- **Recombination Frequency:** Proportional to the physical distance between genes; measured in centimorgans (cM).
- 1% recombination = 1 cM = genes are 1% likely to be separated by crossing over.

---

## 3. Complete vs. Incomplete Linkage
- **Complete Linkage:** Genes are so close that they are almost always inherited together (recombination frequency ≈ 0%).
- **Incomplete Linkage:** Genes are close but not inseparable; some recombination occurs (recombination frequency < 50%).
- **Unlinked Genes:** Located far apart or on different chromosomes (recombination frequency ≈ 50%).

---

## 4. Genetic Mapping
- Recombination frequencies are used to create genetic maps.
- The greater the recombination frequency, the farther apart the genes are.
- Double crossovers can complicate mapping, especially for distant genes.

---

## 5. Clinical and MCAT Relevance
- Linkage analysis is used to track inheritance of disease genes in families.
- Explains why certain traits or diseases are inherited together.
- Important in understanding genetic disorders, gene mapping, and population genetics.

## Quiz

**Q1: What does a recombination frequency of 1% between two genes indicate?**
A) The genes are on different chromosomes
B) The genes are very far apart
C) The genes are very close together *[CORRECT]
D) The genes are always inherited separately
**Explanation:** A 1% recombination frequency means the genes are very close and rarely separated by crossing over.

**Q2: What is the maximum recombination frequency observed between two genes?**
A) 25%
B) 50% *[CORRECT]
C) 75%
D) 100%
**Explanation:** 50% recombination frequency means genes are unlinked (either far apart or on different chromosomes).

**Q3: Which process creates new combinations of alleles between linked genes?**
A) DNA replication
B) Crossing over *[CORRECT]
C) Mitosis
D) Translation
**Explanation:** Crossing over during meiosis exchanges genetic material between homologous chromosomes.

**Q4: What is genetic linkage?**
A) Genes on different chromosomes inherited together
B) Genes close together on the same chromosome inherited together *[CORRECT]
C) Genes that always recombine
D) Genes that mutate together
**Explanation:** Linked genes are physically close on the same chromosome and tend to be inherited together.

**Q5: Why do linked genes violate Mendel's law of independent assortment?**
A) They are on different chromosomes
B) They are always separated by crossing over
C) Their inheritance is not random due to physical proximity *[CORRECT]
D) They are always dominant
**Explanation:** Linked genes do not assort independently because their physical proximity reduces the chance of recombination.
