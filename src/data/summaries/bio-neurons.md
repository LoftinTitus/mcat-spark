# Neurons: Types, Structure, and Function

## Overview
Neurons are the fundamental units of the nervous system, responsible for receiving, processing, and transmitting information via electrical and chemical signals. Understanding neuron types, structure, and function is essential for the MCAT.

## 1. Neuron Structure
- **Cell Body (Soma):** Contains the nucleus and organelles; integrates incoming signals
- **Dendrites:** Branch-like extensions that receive signals from other neurons
- **Axon:** Long projection that transmits electrical impulses (action potentials) away from the cell body
- **Axon Hillock:** Region where action potentials are initiated
- **Myelin Sheath:** Insulating layer (produced by Schwann cells in PNS, oligodendrocytes in CNS) that increases conduction speed
- **Nodes of Ranvier:** Gaps in myelin where action potentials are regenerated (saltatory conduction)
- **Axon Terminals (Synaptic Boutons):** Release neurotransmitters to communicate with target cells

## 2. Types of Neurons
- **Sensory (Afferent) Neurons:**
  - Carry information from sensory receptors to the CNS
  - Example: Touch, pain, temperature receptors
- **Motor (Efferent) Neurons:**
  - Transmit signals from the CNS to muscles or glands
  - Example: Neurons controlling muscle contraction
- **Interneurons:**
  - Connect neurons within the CNS; most abundant type
  - Integrate sensory and motor information
- **Other Classifications:**
  - **Unipolar:** One process (common in sensory neurons)
  - **Bipolar:** One axon, one dendrite (e.g., retina)
  - **Multipolar:** One axon, many dendrites (most common)

## 3. Neuron Function
- **Resting Membrane Potential:** Maintained by Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase and selective ion permeability
- **Action Potential:** Rapid depolarization and repolarization of the membrane; all-or-none event
- **Synaptic Transmission:**
  - Electrical signal reaches axon terminal
  - Triggers release of neurotransmitters into synaptic cleft
  - Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on postsynaptic cell, causing excitatory or inhibitory response
- **Integration:** Neurons sum excitatory and inhibitory inputs to determine if an action potential will fire

---

## 4. Clinical and MCAT Relevance
- **Multiple Sclerosis:** Demyelination slows or blocks action potentials
- **Neurotransmitter Disorders:** Imbalances linked to depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease
- **Reflex Arcs:** Involve sensory, interneuron, and motor neuron pathways

## Quiz

**Q1: What is the main function of dendrites?**
A) Transmit signals away from the cell body
B) Receive signals from other neurons *[CORRECT]
C) Insulate the axon
D) Release neurotransmitters
**Explanation:** Dendrites receive incoming signals from other neurons.

**Q2: Which type of neuron carries information from the CNS to muscles?**
A) Sensory neuron
B) Interneuron
C) Motor neuron *[CORRECT]
D) Bipolar neuron
**Explanation:** Motor (efferent) neurons transmit signals from the CNS to effectors like muscles.

**Q3: What is the role of the myelin sheath?**
A) Generate action potentials
B) Store neurotransmitters
C) Increase speed of action potential conduction *[CORRECT]
D) Integrate synaptic inputs
**Explanation:** Myelin insulates the axon, allowing faster signal transmission via saltatory conduction.

**Q4: Where are action potentials typically initiated?**
A) Dendrites
B) Axon hillock *[CORRECT]
C) Axon terminal
D) Soma
**Explanation:** The axon hillock is the site where action potentials are generated.

**Q5: Which glial cell forms myelin in the peripheral nervous system (PNS)?**
A) Oligodendrocyte
B) Schwann cell *[CORRECT]
C) Astrocyte
D) Microglia
**Explanation:** Schwann cells myelinate axons in the PNS; oligodendrocytes do so in the CNS.
