# Meiosis vs. Mitosis

## Overview
Meiosis and mitosis are two distinct types of cell division. Mitosis produces identical somatic cells for growth and repair, while meiosis produces genetically unique gametes for sexual reproduction. Understanding their differences is crucial for the MCAT.

## 1. Purpose and Outcome
- **Mitosis:**
  - Produces two genetically identical diploid cells
  - For growth, tissue repair, and asexual reproduction
- **Meiosis:**
  - Produces four genetically unique haploid gametes
  - For sexual reproduction, ensures genetic diversity

---

## 2. Number of Divisions
- **Mitosis:** One cell division (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase)
- **Meiosis:** Two sequential divisions (Meiosis I and II)

---

## 3. Chromosome Number
- **Mitosis:** Maintains chromosome number (2n → 2n)
- **Meiosis:** Halves chromosome number (2n → n)

---

## 4. Genetic Variation
- **Mitosis:** No crossing over or recombination; daughter cells are clones
- **Meiosis:** Crossing over (Prophase I) and independent assortment create genetic diversity

---

## 5. Key Events and Differences
- **Synapsis & Crossing Over:**
  - Only in meiosis (Prophase I)
- **Separation:**
  - Mitosis: Sister chromatids separate
  - Meiosis I: Homologous chromosomes separate; Meiosis II: Sister chromatids separate
- **Result:**
  - Mitosis: 2 diploid cells
  - Meiosis: 4 haploid cells

---

## 6. Clinical Relevance
- **Cancer:** Uncontrolled mitosis leads to tumor formation
- **Genetic Disorders:** Errors in meiosis (nondisjunction) cause aneuploidy (e.g., Down syndrome)
