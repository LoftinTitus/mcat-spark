# Inheritance Patterns

## Overview
Inheritance patterns describe how genetic traits and disorders are transmitted from parents to offspring. Understanding these patterns is essential for interpreting pedigrees, predicting genetic risk, and mastering MCAT genetics questions.

## 1. Mendelian Inheritance
- **Autosomal Dominant:**
  - Only one copy of the mutant allele needed for phenotype
  - Affects males and females equally; seen in every generation
  - Example: Huntington's disease, Marfan syndrome
- **Autosomal Recessive:**
  - Two copies of the mutant allele needed for phenotype
  - Often skips generations; affects males and females equally
  - Example: Cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia
- **X-Linked Dominant:**
  - Mutant gene on X chromosome; affects both sexes, but often more severe in males
  - Affected fathers pass to all daughters, not sons
  - Example: Rett syndrome
- **X-Linked Recessive:**
  - More common in males (only one X chromosome)
  - Affected mothers pass to all sons; carrier females may be unaffected
  - Example: Hemophilia A, Duchenne muscular dystrophy
- **Y-Linked (Holandric):**
  - Only males affected; passed from father to all sons
  - Example: Y-linked infertility

## 2. Non-Mendelian Inheritance
- **Mitochondrial (Maternal) Inheritance:**
  - Mitochondria (and their DNA) are inherited only from the mother
  - All children of affected mothers may show the trait; fathers do not pass it on
  - Example: Leber hereditary optic neuropathy
- **Codominance:**
  - Both alleles expressed equally in heterozygotes
  - Example: ABO blood groups (AB type)
- **Incomplete Dominance:**
  - Heterozygote phenotype is intermediate between homozygotes
  - Example: Pink snapdragons (red x white)
- **Anticipation:**
  - Disease severity increases or age of onset decreases in successive generations
  - Example: Huntington's disease, myotonic dystrophy
- **Genomic Imprinting:**
  - Expression depends on parent of origin (some genes silenced depending on whether inherited from mother or father)
  - Example: Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes

## 3. Pedigree Analysis
- Used to determine inheritance pattern in families
- Key clues: sex ratio, skipping generations, father-to-son transmission, maternal inheritance

---

## 4. MCAT Relevance
- Recognize inheritance patterns in pedigrees
- Predict risk of offspring inheriting a trait
- Understand exceptions to Mendelian rules

## Quiz

**Q1: Which inheritance pattern is characterized by affected males passing the trait to all sons but never to daughters?**
A) X-linked dominant
B) X-linked recessive
C) Y-linked *[CORRECT]
D) Mitochondrial
**Explanation:** Y-linked traits are only passed from father to son.

**Q2: What is the expected outcome if a mother with a mitochondrial disorder has children?**
A) Only sons are affected
B) Only daughters are affected
C) All children may be affected *[CORRECT]
D) No children are affected
**Explanation:** Mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother by all offspring.

**Q3: Which pattern is most likely if a trait appears in every generation and affects both sexes equally?**
A) Autosomal dominant *[CORRECT]
B) Autosomal recessive
C) X-linked recessive
D) Mitochondrial
**Explanation:** Autosomal dominant traits typically appear in every generation and affect both sexes.

**Q4: What is codominance?**
A) One allele is completely dominant
B) Both alleles are expressed equally *[CORRECT]
C) Heterozygote is intermediate
D) Only one sex is affected
**Explanation:** In codominance, both alleles contribute to the phenotype (e.g., AB blood type).

**Q5: Which phenomenon describes a disease that worsens or appears earlier in successive generations?**
A) Incomplete dominance
B) Anticipation *[CORRECT]
C) Imprinting
D) Codominance
**Explanation:** Anticipation is when a genetic disorder becomes more severe or has earlier onset in later generations.
