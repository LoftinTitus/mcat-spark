## Social Psychology

### Attribution
**Internal (dispositional):** behavior due to personality or traits
**External (situational):** behavior due to environment or circumstances

- **Fundamental Attribution Error:** Overattribute others' behavior to internal factors, underestimate situational factors
- **Actor-Observer Bias:** Attribute own actions to situation, others' to disposition
- **Self-serving bias:** Attribute success to self (internal), failure to situation (external)
- **Just-world hypothesis:** Belief that people get what they deserve (can lead to victim blaming)

### Social Influence
**Conformity (Asch):** Adjusting behavior or thinking to match group norms
**Obedience (Milgram):** Following direct orders from authority
**Compliance:** Agreeing to requests from others (not authority)

**Compliance Techniques:**
- **Foot-in-the-door:** Small request first, then larger request
- **Door-in-the-face:** Large request refused, then smaller request
- **Lowball technique:** Agree to low cost, then raise cost
- **That's-not-all:** Add incentives before final agreement

### Group Dynamics
- **Social facilitation:** Improved performance on simple tasks in presence of others; impaired on complex tasks
- **Social loafing:** Less effort exerted by individuals in a group
- **Groupthink:** Desire for harmony or conformity leads to poor decision-making
- **Deindividuation:** Loss of self-awareness and restraint in groups (e.g., mob behavior)
- **Bystander effect:** Less likely to help when others are present (diffusion of responsibility)
- **Group polarization:** Group discussion strengthens dominant position

### Attitudes
**Components:**
- **Affective:** feelings/emotions
- **Behavioral:** actions
- **Cognitive:** beliefs/thoughts

- **Cognitive Dissonance:** Discomfort from holding conflicting attitudes/behaviors; motivates change in attitude or behavior to reduce discomfort
- **Persuasion:** Central route (logic, facts) vs. peripheral route (superficial cues)

### Stereotypes, Prejudice, Discrimination
- **Stereotype:** Cognitive (beliefs about a group)
- **Prejudice:** Affective (feelings toward a group)
- **Discrimination:** Behavioral (actions toward a group)
- **Implicit bias:** Unconscious attitudes or stereotypes
- **In-group/out-group bias:** Favoring one's own group over others
