## Social Psychology

### Attribution

**External (situational)**: behavior due to circumstances

**Fundamental Attribution Error**: Overattribute others' behavior to internal factors

**Self-serving bias**: Attribute success to self, failure to situation

### Social Influence

**Obedience** (Milgram): following authority
**Compliance**: agreeing to requests

Techniques:
- Foot-in-the-door: small request → big request
- Door-in-the-face: big request (refused) → small request

### Group Dynamics

→ Change attitude or behavior to reduce
