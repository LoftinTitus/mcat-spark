# DNA & Genome Structure

## Overview
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the hereditary material in all living organisms. Its structure and organization are essential for storage, replication, and expression of genetic information. The human genome contains ~3 billion base pairs and ~20,000 protein-coding genes.

## 1. DNA Structure
- **Double helix:** Two antiparallel strands (5'→3' and 3'→5') form a right-handed helix (B-DNA)
- **Nucleotides:** Each consists of a deoxyribose sugar, phosphate group, and nitrogenous base (A, T, G, C)
- **Base pairing:** A–T (2 H-bonds), G–C (3 H-bonds); G–C pairs confer greater stability (higher melting temp)
- **Backbone:** Sugar-phosphate, with bases projecting inward
- **Major and minor grooves:** Sites for sequence-specific protein binding (e.g., transcription factors)
- **Chargaff's rules:** %A = %T, %G = %C in double-stranded DNA
- **Directionality:** 5' phosphate to 3' hydroxyl; DNA polymerases add nucleotides to 3' end

## 2. DNA Forms & Variants
- **B-DNA:** Most common, right-handed helix, ~10 bp/turn, hydrated
- **A-DNA:** Right-handed, more compact, found in dehydrated samples and some DNA-RNA hybrids
- **Z-DNA:** Left-handed, zigzag backbone, may play a role in gene regulation and supercoiling
- **Single-stranded DNA:** Found in some viruses

## 3. Chromatin & Genome Organization
- **Chromatin:** DNA + histone proteins; compacts DNA to fit in nucleus
- **Nucleosome:** ~147 bp DNA wrapped 1.7x around histone octamer (2x H2A, H2B, H3, H4)
- **Linker DNA:** Connects nucleosomes; H1 histone stabilizes higher-order structure
- **Euchromatin:** Loosely packed, transcriptionally active, accessible to enzymes
- **Heterochromatin:** Densely packed, transcriptionally silent, includes centromeres/telomeres
- **Supercoiling:** Further compacts DNA; topoisomerases relieve torsional stress during replication/transcription
- **Higher-order folding:** Loops, domains, and chromosome territories in nucleus

## 4. Genome Structure & Features
- **Prokaryotes:** Single circular chromosome, often with plasmids (extrachromosomal DNA)
- **Eukaryotes:** Multiple linear chromosomes in nucleus; each chromosome has one long DNA molecule
- **Telomeres:** Repetitive DNA (TTAGGG in humans) at chromosome ends, protect from degradation and prevent end-to-end fusion; shortened with each cell division, maintained by telomerase in stem/germ/cancer cells
- **Centromeres:** Constricted region, essential for chromosome segregation during mitosis/meiosis; site of kinetochore assembly
- **Origins of replication:** Specific sites where DNA replication begins; eukaryotes have many per chromosome
- **Non-coding DNA:** Includes introns, regulatory sequences (promoters, enhancers, silencers), repetitive elements (microsatellites, transposons, LINEs/SINEs)
- **Mitochondrial DNA:** Small, circular, maternally inherited, encodes some mitochondrial proteins/tRNAs/rRNAs

## 5. Key Concepts & Clinical Relevance
- **Histone modifications:** Acetylation (activates transcription), methylation (can activate or repress), phosphorylation, ubiquitination
- **DNA methylation:** Addition of methyl groups to cytosine (CpG islands), usually represses gene expression (epigenetic regulation)
- **Epigenetics:** Heritable changes in gene expression not due to DNA sequence (e.g., DNA/histone modifications)
- **Karyotype:** Chromosome complement of a cell, used to detect chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., trisomy 21)
- **Genomic variation:** SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), copy number variations, structural variants (insertions, deletions, inversions, translocations)
- **Clinical examples:** Fragile X syndrome (repeat expansion), cancer (chromosomal translocations, telomerase reactivation)
