# Culture

## Overview
Culture encompasses the beliefs, behaviors, objects, and other characteristics shared by members of a society. It shapes how individuals perceive the world, interact with others, and interpret experiences. On the MCAT, understanding culture is essential for analyzing social phenomena, health disparities, and patient-provider interactions.

## Elements of Culture
- **Material Culture:** Physical objects, resources, and spaces (e.g., technology, clothing, architecture).
- **Nonmaterial Culture:** Ideas, beliefs, values, norms, language, symbols, customs.
- **Symbols and Language:** Systems of meaning and communication; language is the primary means of cultural transmission.
- **Values and Beliefs:** Standards for what is good, desirable, and proper; beliefs are convictions held to be true.
- **Norms:** Rules and expectations for behavior; can be formal (laws) or informal (folkways, mores, taboos).

## Types of Culture
- **Dominant Culture:** The main cultural practices and values in a society.
- **Subculture:** Groups with distinct values and behaviors within a larger culture (e.g., youth culture, professional groups).
- **Counterculture:** Groups that reject and oppose dominant cultural norms (e.g., hippies, punk movement).
- **Multiculturalism:** Recognition and respect for cultural diversity within a society.
- **Cultural Transmission:** The process by which culture is passed from one generation to the next (socialization).
- **Cultural Diffusion:** Spread of cultural elements between societies (e.g., food, technology, language).

## Culture and Identity
- **Cultural Assimilation:** Process by which individuals or groups adopt the culture of another group, often losing aspects of their original culture.
- **Cultural Integration:** Blending of cultures while maintaining distinct identities.
- **Ethnocentrism:** Judging another culture by the standards of one's own; can lead to prejudice and misunderstanding.
- **Cultural Relativism:** Understanding a culture on its own terms, without judgment.

## Culture and Health
- **Cultural Competence:** Ability of healthcare providers to understand and respect cultural differences in health beliefs and practices.
- **Health Disparities:** Differences in health outcomes linked to cultural, social, and economic factors.
- **Stigma:** Negative attitudes toward certain cultural practices or health conditions.

## MCAT Connections
