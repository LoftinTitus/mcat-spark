# Mitochondria

## Overview
Mitochondria are double-membraned organelles known as the "powerhouses" of eukaryotic cells. They generate most of the cell's ATP via aerobic respiration and play key roles in metabolism, apoptosis, and disease. Their unique features are highly relevant for the MCAT.

## 1. Structure
- **Double membrane:**
  - **Outer membrane:** Permeable to small molecules (porins)
  - **Inner membrane:** Impermeable, highly folded into cristae (increases surface area)
- **Matrix:** Innermost compartment; contains enzymes, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), ribosomes
- **Intermembrane space:** Between inner and outer membranes

---

## 2. Function
- **ATP production:**
  - **Citric acid (Krebs) cycle:** In matrix; generates NADH, FADH₂
  - **Electron transport chain (ETC):** Inner membrane; uses NADH/FADH₂ to pump protons, create gradient
  - **Oxidative phosphorylation:** ATP synthase uses proton gradient to make ATP
- **Apoptosis:** Release of cytochrome c triggers programmed cell death
- **Metabolism:** Fatty acid β-oxidation, amino acid metabolism, urea cycle (part)
- **Calcium storage:** Helps regulate cellular Ca²⁺

---

## 3. Genetics & Origin
- **mtDNA:** Circular, maternally inherited, encodes some ETC proteins, tRNAs, rRNAs
- **Replication:** Independent of nuclear DNA, via binary fission
- **Endosymbiotic theory:** Mitochondria evolved from ancestral prokaryotes engulfed by early eukaryotes
- **Ribosomes:** 70S (prokaryote-like)

---

## 4. Clinical & MCAT Relevance
- **Mitochondrial diseases:** Affect high-energy tissues (muscle, nerve); often maternally inherited
- **Apoptosis:** Dysregulation linked to cancer, neurodegeneration
- **Drug toxicity:** Some drugs (e.g., certain antibiotics) can impair mitochondrial function
- **Aging:** Accumulation of mtDNA mutations may contribute
- **Uncouplers:** Disrupt proton gradient, generate heat (e.g., DNP, brown fat)

## Quiz

**Q1: Where does the citric acid (Krebs) cycle occur in mitochondria?**
A) Outer membrane
B) Matrix *[CORRECT]
C) Intermembrane space
D) Inner membrane
**Explanation:** The Krebs cycle enzymes are located in the mitochondrial matrix.

**Q2: What is the main function of the electron transport chain?**
A) Synthesize glucose
B) Pump protons to create a gradient for ATP synthesis *[CORRECT]
C) Replicate mtDNA
D) Store calcium
**Explanation:** The ETC pumps protons across the inner membrane, driving ATP synthesis.

**Q3: How are mitochondria inherited in humans?**
A) Paternally
B) Maternally *[CORRECT]
C) Biparentally
D) Randomly
**Explanation:** Mitochondria (and mtDNA) are inherited almost exclusively from the mother.

**Q4: Which theory explains the origin of mitochondria?**
A) Cell theory
B) Endosymbiotic theory *[CORRECT]
C) Germ theory
D) Spontaneous generation
**Explanation:** The endosymbiotic theory states mitochondria evolved from engulfed prokaryotes.

**Q5: What is the effect of mitochondrial uncouplers?**
A) Increase ATP production
B) Disrupt proton gradient, generate heat *[CORRECT]
C) Inhibit mtDNA replication
D) Block electron flow
**Explanation:** Uncouplers dissipate the proton gradient, reducing ATP synthesis and producing heat.
