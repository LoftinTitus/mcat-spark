## Male Reproductive System: Structure, Function, and MCAT Relevance

### Overview
The male reproductive system is responsible for the production, maturation, and delivery of sperm, as well as the synthesis of male sex hormones (androgens). It plays a key role in sexual development, fertility, and secondary sex characteristics.

### Anatomy and Structure
- **Testes:** Paired organs in the scrotum; site of spermatogenesis and testosterone production
  - **Seminiferous tubules:** Location of sperm production; lined by Sertoli cells (support/nourish developing sperm)
  - **Leydig cells:** Interstitial cells; produce testosterone in response to LH
- **Epididymis:** Coiled duct atop each testis; sperm maturation and storage
- **Vas deferens:** Muscular tube; transports sperm from epididymis to ejaculatory duct
- **Seminal vesicles:** Secrete fructose-rich fluid; energy for sperm
- **Prostate gland:** Secretes alkaline fluid; neutralizes vaginal acidity, enhances sperm motility
- **Bulbourethral (Cowper's) glands:** Secrete mucus for lubrication
- **Urethra:** Common passage for urine and semen
- **Penis:** Organ for copulation and sperm delivery

### Spermatogenesis
- **Process:** Spermatogonia (stem cells) → primary spermatocytes → secondary spermatocytes → spermatids → spermatozoa
- **Location:** Seminiferous tubules
- **Hormonal regulation:**
  - **FSH:** Stimulates Sertoli cells and spermatogenesis
  - **LH:** Stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone
  - **Testosterone:** Promotes spermatogenesis, secondary sex characteristics

### Sperm Structure
- **Head:** Contains nucleus (DNA) and acrosome (enzymes for egg penetration)
- **Midpiece:** Packed with mitochondria (energy for motility)
- **Tail (flagellum):** Propels sperm

### MCAT Clinical Relevance
- **Infertility:** Causes include low sperm count, motility defects, hormonal imbalances, obstruction
- **Cryptorchidism:** Undescended testes; risk of infertility and cancer
- **Prostate disorders:** Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer
- **Hormonal disorders:** Klinefelter syndrome (XXY), androgen insensitivity
- **Vasectomy:** Surgical sterilization by cutting vas deferens

## Quiz

**Q1: Which cell type in the testes produces testosterone?**
A) Sertoli cell
B) Leydig cell *[CORRECT]
C) Spermatogonia
D) Epididymal cell
**Explanation:** Leydig cells, located in the interstitial space of the testes, synthesize testosterone.

**Q2: What is the function of the acrosome in sperm?**
A) Provides energy
B) Contains enzymes for egg penetration *[CORRECT]
C) Propels sperm
D) Stores DNA
**Explanation:** The acrosome contains hydrolytic enzymes that help sperm penetrate the egg's outer layers.

**Q3: Which hormone stimulates Sertoli cells and spermatogenesis?**
A) LH
B) FSH *[CORRECT]
C) Testosterone
D) Estrogen
**Explanation:** FSH acts on Sertoli cells to support sperm development.

**Q4: What is the main function of the prostate gland?**
A) Sperm production
B) Secretion of alkaline fluid *[CORRECT]
C) Testosterone synthesis
D) Sperm storage
**Explanation:** The prostate secretes alkaline fluid to neutralize vaginal acidity and enhance sperm motility.

**Q5: What is the effect of a vasectomy?**
A) Prevents sperm production
B) Prevents sperm from entering semen *[CORRECT]
C) Prevents testosterone production
D) Prevents erection
**Explanation:** Vasectomy involves cutting the vas deferens, preventing sperm from being included in ejaculate.
