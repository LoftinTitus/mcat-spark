# The Heart: Structure, Function, and MCAT Relevance

## Overview
The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients while removing waste. Its anatomy, physiology, and clinical relevance are high-yield for the MCAT.

## 1. Heart Structure
- **Chambers:**
  - Four chambers: right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, left ventricle
  - **Atria:** Receive blood (right: from body, left: from lungs)
  - **Ventricles:** Pump blood out (right: to lungs, left: to body)
- **Valves:**
  - Ensure unidirectional blood flow
  - **Atrioventricular (AV) Valves:**
    - Tricuspid (right), bicuspid/mitral (left)
  - **Semilunar Valves:**
    - Pulmonary (right), aortic (left)
- **Septum:**
  - Divides right and left sides; prevents mixing of oxygenated/deoxygenated blood
- **Wall Layers:**
  - **Endocardium:** Inner lining
  - **Myocardium:** Muscular middle layer (contracts)
  - **Epicardium/Pericardium:** Outer layers; pericardial sac contains fluid for lubrication

## 2. Blood Flow Pathway
1. Deoxygenated blood enters right atrium via superior/inferior vena cava
2. Passes through tricuspid valve to right ventricle
3. Pumped through pulmonary valve to pulmonary arteries (to lungs)
4. Oxygenated blood returns via pulmonary veins to left atrium
5. Passes through mitral valve to left ventricle
6. Pumped through aortic valve to aorta (to body)

---

## 3. Electrical Conduction System
- **Sinoatrial (SA) Node:** Pacemaker; initiates heartbeat
- **Atrioventricular (AV) Node:** Delays impulse, allows atria to contract before ventricles
- **Bundle of His, Bundle Branches, Purkinje Fibers:** Rapidly conduct impulse through ventricles
- **ECG/EKG:** Measures electrical activity; P wave (atrial depolarization), QRS (ventricular depolarization), T wave (ventricular repolarization)

---

## 4. Cardiac Cycle and Function
- **Systole:** Ventricular contraction; blood ejected
- **Diastole:** Ventricular relaxation; chambers fill
- **Stroke Volume:** Amount of blood pumped per beat
- **Cardiac Output:** Volume pumped per minute (CO = HR x SV)
- **Heart Rate Regulation:** Autonomic nervous system (sympathetic increases, parasympathetic decreases)

---

## 5. Clinical and MCAT Relevance
- **Heart Failure:** Inability to pump sufficient blood; causes fatigue, edema
- **Arrhythmias:** Abnormal electrical activity; can cause palpitations, syncope
- **Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack):** Blocked coronary artery; tissue death
- **Valve Disorders:** Stenosis (narrowing), regurgitation (leakage)
- **Congenital Defects:** Septal defects, valve malformations
- **Hypertension:** Increased afterload; can lead to heart failure

## Quiz

**Q1: Which chamber pumps oxygenated blood to the body?**
A) Right atrium
B) Right ventricle
C) Left atrium
D) Left ventricle *[CORRECT]
**Explanation:** The left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood into the aorta for systemic circulation.

**Q2: What is the function of the tricuspid valve?**
A) Prevents backflow into left atrium
B) Prevents backflow into right atrium *[CORRECT]
C) Prevents backflow into left ventricle
D) Prevents backflow into pulmonary artery
**Explanation:** The tricuspid valve prevents backflow from the right ventricle to the right atrium.

**Q3: What initiates the heartbeat?**
A) AV node
B) Purkinje fibers
C) SA node *[CORRECT]
D) Bundle of His
**Explanation:** The SA node is the heart's pacemaker, initiating each heartbeat.

**Q4: What is systole?**
A) Ventricular relaxation
B) Atrial relaxation
C) Ventricular contraction *[CORRECT]
D) Atrial contraction
**Explanation:** Systole is the phase when ventricles contract and eject blood.

**Q5: Which condition results from blocked coronary arteries?**
A) Arrhythmia
B) Myocardial infarction (heart attack) *[CORRECT]
C) Valve stenosis
D) Hypertension
**Explanation:** Myocardial infarction is caused by blockage of coronary arteries, leading to heart tissue death.
