## Female Reproductive System: Structure, Function, and MCAT Relevance

### Overview
The female reproductive system is responsible for the production of ova (eggs), secretion of sex hormones, support of fertilization, and development of the embryo and fetus. It also regulates the menstrual cycle and secondary sex characteristics.

### Anatomy and Structure
- **Ovaries:** Paired organs; site of oogenesis and hormone production (estrogen, progesterone)
  - **Follicles:** Contain developing oocytes; secrete hormones
- **Fallopian tubes (oviducts):** Transport ova from ovary to uterus; site of fertilization
- **Uterus:** Muscular organ; supports embryo/fetus; endometrium (lining) undergoes cyclic changes
- **Cervix:** Lower part of uterus; produces mucus, barrier to pathogens
- **Vagina:** Muscular canal; receives penis during intercourse; birth canal
- **External genitalia (vulva):** Labia majora/minora, clitoris

### Oogenesis and Menstrual Cycle
- **Oogenesis:**
  - Begins before birth; primary oocytes arrested in prophase I
  - At ovulation, meiosis I completes → secondary oocyte + polar body
  - Secondary oocyte arrested in metaphase II until fertilization
  - Meiosis II completes only if fertilization occurs
- **Menstrual cycle:**
  - **Follicular phase:** FSH stimulates follicle growth; estrogen rises
  - **Ovulation:** LH surge triggers release of secondary oocyte
  - **Luteal phase:** Corpus luteum forms; secretes progesterone and estrogen
  - **Menstruation:** Shedding of endometrial lining if no fertilization

### Hormonal Regulation
- **FSH:** Stimulates follicle growth and oocyte maturation
- **LH:** Triggers ovulation and corpus luteum formation
- **Estrogen:** Promotes endometrial growth, secondary sex characteristics
- **Progesterone:** Maintains endometrium, inhibits uterine contractions

### MCAT Clinical Relevance
- **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS):** Disrupted ovulation, infertility
- **Endometriosis:** Ectopic endometrial tissue, pain, infertility
- **Menstrual disorders:** Amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea
- **Ectopic pregnancy:** Implantation outside uterus
- **Hormonal contraception:** Inhibits ovulation via negative feedback
- **Ovarian cancer:** Malignancy of ovarian tissue

## Quiz

**Q1: Where does fertilization typically occur in the female reproductive tract?**
A) Ovary
B) Fallopian tube *[CORRECT]
C) Uterus
D) Vagina
**Explanation:** Fertilization usually occurs in the ampulla of the fallopian tube.

**Q2: Which hormone triggers ovulation?**
A) FSH
B) LH *[CORRECT]
C) Estrogen
D) Progesterone
**Explanation:** The LH surge causes the release of the secondary oocyte from the ovary.

**Q3: What is the main function of progesterone during the menstrual cycle?**
A) Stimulates follicle growth
B) Maintains the endometrial lining *[CORRECT]
C) Triggers ovulation
D) Promotes secondary sex characteristics
**Explanation:** Progesterone maintains the endometrium for possible implantation.

**Q4: What is the fate of the corpus luteum if fertilization does not occur?**
A) It persists
B) It degenerates *[CORRECT]
C) It becomes the placenta
D) It releases an oocyte
**Explanation:** The corpus luteum degenerates, leading to a drop in progesterone and menstruation.

**Q5: Which disorder is characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue?**
A) PCOS
B) Endometriosis *[CORRECT]
C) Amenorrhea
D) Ovarian cancer
**Explanation:** Endometriosis involves endometrial tissue outside the uterus, causing pain and infertility.
