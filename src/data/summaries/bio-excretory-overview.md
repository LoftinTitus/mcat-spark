# Overview of the Excretory System: MCAT Review

The excretory system is responsible for removing metabolic wastes, maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance, and regulating blood pressure and pH. The kidneys are the primary organs, but the system also includes the ureters, bladder, urethra, skin, lungs, and liver.

## Major Components
- **Kidneys:** Filter blood, form urine, regulate water, electrolytes, and acid-base balance.
- **Ureters:** Muscular tubes that transport urine from kidneys to bladder.
- **Bladder:** Stores urine until excretion.
- **Urethra:** Conducts urine from bladder to outside the body.
- **Other Organs:**
  - **Skin:** Excretes water, salts, and urea via sweat.
  - **Lungs:** Remove CO2 (a metabolic waste) and water vapor.
  - **Liver:** Converts ammonia to urea for renal excretion; metabolizes drugs and toxins.

## Kidney Functions
- **Filtration:** Occurs in glomerulus; removes water, ions, glucose, urea, and small molecules from blood.
- **Reabsorption:** Selective uptake of water, ions, and nutrients back into blood (mainly in proximal tubule).
- **Secretion:** Active transport of substances (H+, K+, drugs) from blood into nephron for excretion.
- **Excretion:** Removal of urine containing metabolic wastes, excess ions, and water.

## Homeostatic Roles
- **Fluid Balance:** Adjusts water reabsorption to maintain blood volume.
- **Electrolyte Balance:** Regulates Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl-, and phosphate levels.
- **Acid-Base Balance:** Secretes H+, reabsorbs HCO3- to maintain pH.
- **Blood Pressure Regulation:** Via RAAS, ADH, and ANP.

## Clinical Relevance
- **Renal Failure:** Leads to accumulation of toxins, fluid overload, electrolyte imbalance, and acidosis.
- **Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):** Affect bladder, urethra, or kidneys; can impair excretion.
- **Diabetes Insipidus:** Deficiency of ADH; causes excessive urine output and dehydration.
- **Nephrolithiasis (Kidney Stones):** Crystallized minerals block urine flow, cause pain and infection.

## Quiz

**Q1: Which organ is primarily responsible for filtering blood and forming urine?**
A) Liver
B) Kidney *[CORRECT]
C) Bladder
D) Skin
**Explanation:** The kidneys filter blood and form urine; other organs have secondary excretory roles.

**Q2: What is the main function of the ureters?**
A) Store urine
B) Filter blood
C) Transport urine from kidneys to bladder *[CORRECT]
D) Reabsorb water
**Explanation:** Ureters are muscular tubes that carry urine to the bladder.

**Q3: Which process in the nephron involves selective uptake of water and nutrients back into the blood?**
A) Filtration
B) Reabsorption *[CORRECT]
C) Secretion
D) Excretion
**Explanation:** Reabsorption returns useful substances to the blood, mainly in the proximal tubule.

**Q4: How does the skin contribute to excretion?**
A) By filtering blood
B) By excreting water, salts, and urea via sweat *[CORRECT]
C) By storing urine
D) By regulating blood pressure
**Explanation:** Sweat glands in the skin excrete water, salts, and small amounts of urea.

**Q5: What is a consequence of renal failure?**
A) Accumulation of metabolic wastes
B) Fluid overload
C) Electrolyte imbalance
D) All of the above *[CORRECT]
**Explanation:** Renal failure impairs excretion, leading to toxin buildup, fluid overload, and electrolyte disturbances.
