# Subviral Particles: Prions & Viroids

## Overview
Subviral particles are infectious agents even simpler than viruses. They lack many features of viruses and rely entirely on host machinery for propagation. The two main types relevant to the MCAT are prions and viroids.

## 1. Prions
- **Definition:** Infectious, misfolded proteins (no nucleic acid)
- **Structure:** Abnormal conformation of a normal host protein (PrP^Sc vs. PrP^C)
- **Mechanism:** Induce normal proteins to adopt misfolded, pathogenic shape (template-directed misfolding)
- **Accumulation:** Aggregates form amyloid plaques, disrupt cell function, cause cell death
- **Diseases:**
  - **Humans:** Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), variant CJD (mad cow), Kuru, fatal familial insomnia
  - **Animals:** Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, mad cow), scrapie (sheep)
- **Transmission:** Ingestion, inherited mutations, iatrogenic (medical procedures)
- **Key features:**
  - Extremely resistant to heat, radiation, proteases
  - No immune response (no nucleic acid)
  - Long incubation period, always fatal

## 2. Viroids
- **Definition:** Small, circular, single-stranded RNA molecules (no protein coat)
- **Replication:** Use host RNA polymerase; do not encode proteins
- **Pathogenicity:** Cause disease in plants (e.g., potato spindle tuber viroid)
- **Mechanism:** Interfere with host gene expression, may trigger RNA silencing
- **Key features:**
  - Smallest known infectious agents
  - No protein-coding capacity
  - No envelope or capsid
  - Not known to infect animals/humans

## 3. Comparison Table
| Feature         | Prions                | Viroids                |
|----------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Genetic material| None                  | RNA (ss, circular)     |
| Protein coat    | Yes (misfolded host)  | No                     |
| Host range      | Animals (esp. CNS)    | Plants                 |
| Replication     | Template misfolding   | Host RNA polymerase    |
| Immune response | None                  | Minimal                |
| Disease         | Neurodegeneration     | Plant stunting, death  |

## Clinical Relevance
- **Prion diseases:** Rapidly progressive, untreatable neurodegeneration; important in food safety, neurology
- **Viroids:** Major agricultural impact; model for RNA-based regulation

## Quiz

**Q1: What is the genetic material of prions?**
A) DNA
B) RNA
C) Protein only *[CORRECT]
D) DNA and protein
**Explanation:** Prions are infectious proteins with no nucleic acid.

**Q2: Which disease is caused by prions in humans?**
A) Potato spindle tuber disease
B) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) *[CORRECT]
C) Influenza
D) Hepatitis B
**Explanation:** CJD is a human prion disease causing neurodegeneration.

**Q3: How do prions propagate in the host?**
A) By encoding their own polymerase
B) By inducing misfolding of normal host proteins *[CORRECT]
C) By integrating into host DNA
D) By producing viral particles
**Explanation:** Prions convert normal proteins into the misfolded, pathogenic form.

**Q4: What is a key feature of viroids?**
A) They infect animals
B) They encode proteins
C) They are small, circular RNA molecules with no protein coat *[CORRECT]
D) They have a lipid envelope
**Explanation:** Viroids are naked, circular RNA molecules that infect plants.

**Q5: Which of the following is true about prion diseases?**
A) They are easily destroyed by heat and proteases
B) They elicit a strong immune response
C) They are always fatal and have long incubation periods *[CORRECT]
D) They are caused by RNA viruses
**Explanation:** Prion diseases are always fatal, have long incubation, and are highly resistant to destruction.
