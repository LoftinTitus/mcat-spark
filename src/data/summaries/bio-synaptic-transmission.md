# Synaptic Transmission: Mechanisms and MCAT Relevance

## Overview
Synaptic transmission is the process by which neurons communicate with each other or with effector cells (muscle, gland) via synapses. This process is fundamental to all nervous system function and is a high-yield MCAT topic.

## 1. Types of Synapses
- **Electrical Synapses:**
  - Direct cytoplasmic connections via gap junctions
  - Allow rapid, bidirectional transmission (rare in humans; found in cardiac and some smooth muscle)
- **Chemical Synapses:**
  - Most common in the human nervous system
  - Use neurotransmitters to relay signals across a synaptic cleft

## 2. Steps of Chemical Synaptic Transmission
1. **Action Potential Arrival:**
   - Action potential reaches the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron
2. **Calcium Influx:**
   - Voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels open; Ca²⁺ enters the terminal
3. **Vesicle Fusion:**
   - Ca²⁺ triggers synaptic vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane
4. **Neurotransmitter Release:**
   - Neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft by exocytosis
5. **Binding to Receptors:**
   - Neurotransmitters bind to specific receptors on the postsynaptic membrane
6. **Postsynaptic Response:**
   - Ion channels open or close, causing excitatory (EPSP) or inhibitory (IPSP) postsynaptic potentials
7. **Termination:**
   - Neurotransmitter is removed by reuptake, enzymatic degradation, or diffusion

## 3. Neurotransmitters and Receptors
- **Common Neurotransmitters:**
  - Acetylcholine (ACh), glutamate, GABA, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine
- **Receptor Types:**
  - **Ionotropic:** Ligand-gated ion channels (fast, direct)
  - **Metabotropic:** G protein-coupled receptors (slower, indirect, can modulate cell signaling)

---

## 4. Excitatory vs. Inhibitory Transmission
- **Excitatory (EPSP):** Depolarizes postsynaptic membrane (e.g., glutamate)
- **Inhibitory (IPSP):** Hyperpolarizes postsynaptic membrane (e.g., GABA)
- **Summation:** Neurons integrate multiple EPSPs and IPSPs to determine if an action potential will fire

---

## 5. Clinical and MCAT Relevance
- **Drugs and Toxins:** Many act at synapses (e.g., SSRIs, antipsychotics, botulinum toxin)
- **Disorders:** Myasthenia gravis (ACh receptor loss), depression (serotonin imbalance), epilepsy (GABA dysfunction)
- **Synaptic Plasticity:** Basis for learning and memory (e.g., long-term potentiation)

## Quiz

**Q1: What triggers the release of neurotransmitter at a chemical synapse?**
A) Sodium influx
B) Calcium influx *[CORRECT]
C) Potassium efflux
D) Chloride influx
**Explanation:** Calcium entry into the presynaptic terminal triggers vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release.

**Q2: Which type of receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel?**
A) Metabotropic
B) Ionotropic *[CORRECT]
C) G protein-coupled
D) Enzyme-linked
**Explanation:** Ionotropic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission.

**Q3: What is the main mechanism for terminating neurotransmitter action at the synapse?**
A) Only enzymatic degradation
B) Only reuptake
C) Reuptake, enzymatic degradation, or diffusion *[CORRECT]
D) Only diffusion
**Explanation:** Neurotransmitter action is terminated by reuptake, enzymatic breakdown, or diffusion away from the synapse.

**Q4: Which neurotransmitter is the primary inhibitory transmitter in the CNS?**
A) Glutamate
B) Acetylcholine
C) GABA *[CORRECT]
D) Dopamine
**Explanation:** GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.

**Q5: What is an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)?**
A) Hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane
B) Depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane *[CORRECT]
C) Inhibition of neurotransmitter release
D) Blockage of ion channels
**Explanation:** EPSPs depolarize the postsynaptic membrane, bringing it closer to threshold for firing an action potential.
