# Neurobiology of Disorders

## Overview
The neurobiology of psychological disorders explores how changes in brain structure, function, and neurochemistry contribute to the development and manifestation of mental illnesses. On the MCAT, understanding the neural mechanisms underlying major disorders, the role of neurotransmitters, and the impact of genetics and environment is essential for interpreting clinical vignettes and research findings.

## Key Brain Structures and Functions
- **Prefrontal Cortex:** Executive function, decision-making, impulse control; implicated in depression, schizophrenia, ADHD.
- **Amygdala:** Emotion processing, fear, aggression; involved in anxiety disorders, PTSD, depression.
- **Hippocampus:** Memory formation; affected in depression, PTSD, Alzheimer’s disease.
- **Basal Ganglia:** Movement, reward; implicated in OCD, Tourette’s, Parkinson’s disease.
- **Nucleus Accumbens:** Reward, motivation; involved in addiction, depression.
- **Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA):** Dopamine production; reward pathway, addiction.

## Major Neurotransmitters and Disorders
- **Dopamine:** Schizophrenia (excess in mesolimbic pathway), Parkinson’s (deficiency), addiction.
- **Serotonin:** Depression (deficiency), anxiety, OCD, eating disorders.
- **Norepinephrine:** Depression (deficiency), anxiety, PTSD.
- **GABA:** Anxiety disorders (deficiency), epilepsy.
- **Glutamate:** Schizophrenia (dysregulation), excitotoxicity in neurodegeneration.
- **Acetylcholine:** Alzheimer’s disease (deficiency).

## Neurobiological Basis of Major Disorders
- **Depression:** Reduced prefrontal cortex activity, smaller hippocampus, low serotonin/norepinephrine/dopamine.
- **Schizophrenia:** Enlarged ventricles, reduced prefrontal cortex, excess dopamine, glutamate dysregulation.
- **Anxiety Disorders:** Hyperactive amygdala, low GABA/serotonin, high norepinephrine.
- **Bipolar Disorder:** Abnormalities in prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and neurotransmitter systems.
- **Alzheimer’s Disease:** Amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, loss of acetylcholine neurons, hippocampal atrophy.
- **Parkinson’s Disease:** Loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra, basal ganglia dysfunction.
- **Addiction:** Dysregulation of dopamine reward pathway (VTA, nucleus accumbens).

## Genetics, Environment, and Neurodevelopment
- **Genetic Risk:** Family and twin studies show heritability for many disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar, depression).
- **Epigenetics:** Environmental factors (stress, trauma, drugs) can alter gene expression and brain function.
- **Neurodevelopmental Factors:** Prenatal insults, early life stress, and infections can increase risk.

## MCAT Connections
- **Application:** Recognize neurobiological findings in clinical vignettes.
- **Research:** Understand experimental design, imaging, and pharmacological studies.
- **Critical Thinking:** Integrate knowledge of brain, neurotransmitters, and genetics in understanding disorders.

## Quiz

**Q1: Which neurotransmitter is most directly implicated in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia?**
A) Serotonin
B) Dopamine *[CORRECT]
C) GABA
D) Acetylcholine
**Explanation:** Excess dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway is linked to hallucinations and delusions in schizophrenia.

**Q2: Loss of dopaminergic neurons in which brain region is characteristic of Parkinson’s disease?**
A) Hippocampus
B) Substantia nigra *[CORRECT]
C) Amygdala
D) Prefrontal cortex
**Explanation:** The substantia nigra is the primary site of dopamine loss in Parkinson’s disease.

**Q3: Which brain structure is most associated with fear and is hyperactive in anxiety disorders?**
A) Basal ganglia
B) Amygdala *[CORRECT]
C) Prefrontal cortex
D) Hippocampus
**Explanation:** The amygdala is central to fear processing and is often overactive in anxiety disorders.

**Q4: What neurobiological change is commonly seen in Alzheimer’s disease?**
A) Increased dopamine
B) Amyloid plaques and loss of acetylcholine neurons *[CORRECT]
C) Enlarged ventricles
D) Hyperactive amygdala
**Explanation:** Alzheimer’s is marked by amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of acetylcholine neurons.

**Q5: Which neurotransmitter is most closely linked to mood regulation and is often deficient in depression?**
A) Glutamate
B) Serotonin *[CORRECT]
C) Dopamine
D) Norepinephrine
**Explanation:** Low serotonin is a key factor in the neurobiology of depression.
