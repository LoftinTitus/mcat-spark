# Cell Signaling & Gene Expression

## Overview
Cell signaling allows cells to sense and respond to their environment, coordinate activities, and regulate gene expression. Disruptions in signaling pathways are linked to many diseases, including cancer.

## 1. Types of Cell Signaling
- **Autocrine:** Cell signals to itself (e.g., growth factors)
- **Paracrine:** Local signaling to nearby cells (e.g., neurotransmitters, cytokines)
- **Endocrine:** Hormones travel via bloodstream to distant targets (e.g., insulin)
- **Juxtacrine:** Direct cell-to-cell contact (e.g., immune synapse, gap junctions)

---

## 2. Signal Molecules & Receptors
- **Ligands:** Small molecules, peptides, proteins, or gases (e.g., hormones, neurotransmitters)
- **Receptors:**
  - **Cell surface:** Bind hydrophilic ligands (e.g., GPCRs, RTKs, ion channels)
  - **Intracellular:** Bind hydrophobic ligands (e.g., steroid hormones, thyroid hormone)

---

## 3. Major Signaling Pathways
- **G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs):**
  - 7-transmembrane receptors; activate G proteins (Gs, Gi, Gq)
  - **Second messengers:** cAMP (activates PKA), IP3/DAG (release Ca²⁺, activate PKC)
  - **Examples:** Epinephrine, glucagon, odorants
- **Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs):**
  - Dimerize and autophosphorylate upon ligand binding
  - Activate Ras/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and other pathways
  - **Examples:** Insulin, growth factors (EGF, PDGF)
- **Ion channel receptors:**
  - Ligand-gated (e.g., acetylcholine at neuromuscular junction)
  - Voltage-gated (e.g., Na⁺, K⁺ channels in neurons)
- **Intracellular/nuclear receptors:**
  - Steroid/thyroid hormones cross membrane, bind cytosolic/nuclear receptors, act as transcription factors

---

## 4. Signal Transduction & Amplification
- **Cascade:** One ligand can activate many downstream molecules (amplification)
- **Second messengers:** cAMP, cGMP, Ca²⁺, IP3, DAG
- **Kinases/phosphatases:** Add/remove phosphate groups to regulate protein activity
- **Termination:** Phosphodiesterases degrade cAMP/cGMP; phosphatases remove phosphates; receptor desensitization

---

## 5. Regulation of Gene Expression
- **Transcription factors:** Bind DNA at promoters/enhancers to activate or repress transcription (e.g., CREB, p53, NF-κB)
- **Epigenetic regulation:** DNA methylation, histone modification (acetylation, methylation)
- **Chromatin remodeling:** Alters DNA accessibility
- **Non-coding RNAs:** microRNAs, siRNAs regulate mRNA stability/translation
- **Signal-induced gene expression:** Many pathways (e.g., MAPK, cAMP/PKA) activate transcription factors in response to extracellular signals

---

## 6. Clinical Relevance & Examples
- **Cancer:** Mutations in signaling/gene expression pathways (e.g., Ras, p53, HER2)
- **Diabetes:** Insulin signaling defects
- **Pharmacology:** Many drugs target signaling (e.g., β-blockers, kinase inhibitors)
- **Development:** Morphogen gradients, cell fate decisions

## Quiz

**Q1: Which type of receptor is most likely to bind steroid hormones?**
A) G protein-coupled receptor
B) Receptor tyrosine kinase
C) Intracellular/nuclear receptor *[CORRECT]
D) Ion channel
**Explanation:** Steroid hormones are hydrophobic and cross the membrane to bind intracellular receptors.

**Q2: What is the main second messenger produced by adenylyl cyclase activation?**
A) cAMP *[CORRECT]
B) IP3
C) Ca²⁺
D) DAG
**Explanation:** Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP to cAMP, which activates PKA.

**Q3: Which protein acts as a transcription factor in response to cell signaling?**
A) DNA polymerase
B) CREB *[CORRECT]
C) G protein
D) Adenylyl cyclase
**Explanation:** CREB is a transcription factor activated by cAMP/PKA signaling.

**Q4: What is the effect of histone acetylation on gene expression?**
A) Represses transcription
B) Activates transcription *[CORRECT]
C) Causes DNA methylation
D) Degrades mRNA
**Explanation:** Acetylation loosens chromatin, making DNA more accessible for transcription.

**Q5: Which pathway is commonly mutated in cancer and leads to uncontrolled cell growth?**
A) Ras/MAPK pathway *[CORRECT]
B) Glycolysis
C) Urea cycle
D) Fatty acid oxidation
**Explanation:** Mutations in Ras/MAPK signaling are common in cancer and drive proliferation.
