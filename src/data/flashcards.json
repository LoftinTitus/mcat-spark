It promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the kidneys, leading to increased blood volume and pressure. Aldosterone is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is activated in response to low blood pressure or low blood sodium levels."

It increases blood glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis, suppresses inflammation and immune function, and aids in fat, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism. Cortisol levels typically rise in response to stress and follow a diurnal rhythm, peaking in the early morning."

      "back": "Angiotensin is a peptide hormone that plays a key role in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance. The pathway begins with the release of renin from the kidneys in response to low blood pressure or low sodium levels. Renin converts angiotensinogen, a protein produced by the liver, into angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted into angiotensin II by the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), primarily in the lungs. Angiotensin II acts as a potent vasoconstrictor, increasing blood pressure, and stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal glands, promoting sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys."

Its primary function is to regulate water balance in the body by promoting water reabsorption in the kidneys. ADH acts on the collecting ducts of the nephrons, increasing their permeability to water, which allows more water to be reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. This helps to concentrate urine and reduce water loss, thereby maintaining blood pressure and fluid balance."

It receives the electrical impulses generated by the sinoatrial (SA) node and delays them slightly before transmitting them to the bundle of His and subsequently to the Purkinje fibers. This delay allows the atria to fully contract and empty their blood into the ventricles before the ventricles contract, ensuring efficient blood flow through the heart."
