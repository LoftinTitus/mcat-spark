      "passage": "Researchers studied an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of substrate X to product Y. They measured initial reaction velocities at various substrate concentrations in the presence and absence of an unknown inhibitor.\n\nIn the absence of inhibitor, the enzyme showed a Km of 2.5 mM and a Vmax of 100 μmol/min. When the inhibitor was added at a concentration of 1 mM, the apparent Km increased to  5.0 mM while Vmax remained unchanged at 100 μmol/min.\n\nThe researchers also noted that adding excess substrate could overcome the inhibitory effect, restoring the reaction rate to near-normal levels.",
